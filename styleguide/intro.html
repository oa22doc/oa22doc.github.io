<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr>

<p>These coding standards were selected to ensure quality code.</p>

<table cellspacing="8">
<tr>
<th valign=top width=140 align=right>Readability</th>
<td width=680 align=left>All code should be easy to read and understand. 
A knowledgeable user should be able to look at a section of code and quickly 
determine the purpose of the code and how it works.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th valign=top width=140 align=right>Consistency</th>
<td width=680 align=left>Using coding standards ensures consistency throughout 
code created by multiple developers or by the same developer at different times. 
These standards avoid the confusion and frustration of having pieces of code 
look completely different simply because they were created by different people.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th valign=top width=140 align=right>Predictability</th>
<td width=680 align=left>When code is written in a consistent form, the code 
organization and structure are predictable. Users can easily determine where 
to find a particular piece of functionality because its location is established 
by the standards.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th valign=top width=140 align=right>Conciseness</th>
<td width=680 align=left>Coding standards encourage clear, succinct, and 
efficient code, written as simply as possible, with sufficient amounts of 
comments and spacing.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th valign=top width=140 align=right>Maintainability</th>
<td width=680 align=left>Clean, well-designed code is easier to maintain and 
update. Properly documented and structured code is also easier for other developers to understand..</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th valign=top width=140 align=right>Efficiency</th>
<td width=680 align=left>Coding standards support developing code that is as 
fast and efficient as possible, encouraging developers to study and craft each 
line of code and to use the most effective implementation possible.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th valign=top width=140 align=right>Professionalism</th>
<td width=680 align=left>Coding standards encourage professionalism by keeping 
the coding style consistent among developers, avoiding facetious functions and 
variable names, and improving code readability.</td>
</tr>

<strong>Note:</strong> In this document, code under development is differentiated from code that is  ready for use by the rest of the development team. When code is under development, it is acceptable to use whatever  style is appropriate, particularly if the goal is to create a quick prototype to validate an idea. However, once the code passes this point and is made available to the rest of the development team, the coding style described in this document must apply. <br />
