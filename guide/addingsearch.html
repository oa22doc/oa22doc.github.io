		<h1>Adding a Search Solution to OpenAccess Documentation</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
		OpenAccess documentation does not incorporate a search capability because of 
		the large variety of platform and installation configurations that are 
		possible. Most search solutions require a Web server for implementation, but 
		OpenAccess documentation can be installed for access from a file server or 
		CD-ROM. To avoid delivering a solution that is broken in some configurations, 
		the search solution described in this document is not built in but easily added 
		if the documentation is accessed via a Web server.
		<p>The solution described in this document is Perlfect Search. There are a variety 
			of solutions that can be used, but this one is selected because it is available 
			under the GNU General Public License, it is simple to install and configure, 
			and it offers good functionality and performance. Perlfect Search is a suite of 
			Perl scripts for indexing and searching Web pages. The latest version of 
			Perlfect Search can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.perlfect.com/freescripts/search/">				Perlfect Solutions</a> Web site. Because it is based on Perl, the Perlfect 
			Search solution is compatible with all Linux, UNIX, and Windows platforms.</p>
		<h2>Preparations for Installing Perlfect Search</h2>
		<p>Perlfect is available as a tar.gz or .zip archive. Download the archive version 
			that suits your platform or preference. In addition to the Perlfect Search 
			archive, to install and use Perlfect Search, you need:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			A Web server on which you can install and execute CGI scripts.
			<li>
			Perl 5.004 or later
			<li>
				Perl modules:
				<ul>
					<li>
					DB_File 1.72 or later (supports Berkeley DB 1.x.)
					<li>
					Mime::Base64 2.11
					<li>
					Digest::MD5 2.20
					<li>
					URI 1.10
					<li>
					HTML::Tagset 3.03
					<li>
					HTML::Parser 3.15
					<li>
						LWP::libwww-perl 5.50</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>Usually, you do not need to install these modules. Because of their common use, 
			they are usually already installed. You can indirectly check whether a required 
			Perl module is installed by trying to read its documentation. For example, the 
			shell command <code>perldoc DB_File</code> displays the documentation for that 
			module if the module is installed.</p>
		<p>This Perlfect installation and configuration guide assumes that you are familiar 
			with Perl, and you understand how to install Perl modules if necessary. If you 
			are not familiar with Perl, and the required Perl modules are missing from your 
			system, you can refer to the Perlfect Solutions Web site for additional 
			information about acquiring and installing the missing modules, or check with 
			your system administrator.</p>
		<h2>Installing Perlfect Search</h2>
		<p>The numbered steps below explain how you install Perlfect Search. Before you 
			begin the installation, you need to know the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			The path to the Perl executable on your server.
			<li>
				The base URL of the Web site you want to index and search. For example, <code>http://myintranet/doc/oa/</code>
			<li>
				The path to the directory for the site you want to index and search. For 
				example, <code>/usr/local/htdocs/doc/oa/</code>
			<li>
				The URL of your cgi-bin directory. For example, <code>http://myintranet/cgi-bin/</code>
			<li>
				The path to the cgi-bin directory. For example, <code>/usr/local/htdocs/cgi-bin/</code></li>
		</ul>
		<p>The following setup instructions assume you are installing on a Linux or UNIX 
			platform.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Log on to the machine that runs your Web server.
			<li>
			Create a distribution directory such as perlfect_dist.
			<li>
			Download or move the Perlfect distribution archive to the directory you created 
			in the previous step. (For access to the download site, see the Perlfect 
			Solutions URL provided at the beginning of this document.)
			<li>
			Change to the Perlfect distribution directory, and uncompress and/or unarchive 
			the Perlfect Search distribution archive.
			<li>
				Change to the directory where the Perlfect setup scripts were installed by the 
				previous step. For example, for Perlfect 3.31b, use <code>cd search-3.31b</code>
			<li>
				If you need to be root or other user in order to install files in your Web 
				server cgi-bin directory, use <code>su root</code>.
			<li>
				Run the Perlfect Search setup script using the command <code>perl setup.pl</code>.<br>
				<br>
				The setup script prompts you for:
				<ul>
					<li>
					The base URL of the site that you want to index and search.
					<li>
					The URL for your cgi-bin directory where the Web server searches for CGI 
					scripts
					<li>
					The path to your Web server cgi-bin directory
					<li>
						The path to the document root for your Web server</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<br>
				The answers you supply are saved in the Perlfect Search configuration file 
				named <code>conf.pl</code> in the cgi-bin/perlfect/search directory. The 
				configuration file is used by both the indexer and by the search engine. See 
				the previous section for information about what you need to know before you 
				install Perlfect Search.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Notes:</strong>
				<br>
				When you enter a URL during setup, it must include the http:// protocol. When 
				you enter a path, it must start from the root of your Web server. Both URL and 
				path entries must end with the slash ( / ) character.<br>
				<br>
				The base URL is the location at and below which the indexing and searches are 
				performed. You can use the root directory of your Web site to index/search your 
				entire site, or you can specify the URL where only the OpenAccess documentation 
				is installed. For example, to index your entire Web site, you might enter a 
				base URL of <code>http://myIntranet/</code>, but if you only want to index and 
				search the OpenAccess documentation, you might enter a base URL of http:<code>//myIntranet/doc/oa/</code>.<br>
				<br>
			<li>
			After entering the required setup information you are prompted to choose 
			whether to index the site or finish. You can index your site at this time, or 
			do so in a later step.
			<li>
			When the installation is complete, change to the directory where the Perlfect 
			Search scripts are installed (for example, cgi-bin/perlfect/search).
			<li>
				If you did not index your site as part of the setup process, you can validate 
				that the installation is correct and functioning now by using the command <code>perl 
					indexer.pl</code>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The last step starts the indexer to process the pages on your site and to create 
			an index database. Indexing the OpenAccess documentation takes a while since 
			there are approximately 3800 files to process. The indexer uses the conf.pl 
			configuration file you created during the Perlfect Search setup step. If the 
			indexer produces an error, or does not appear to index your site correctly, you 
			can use a text editor to browse the conf.pl file in the cgi-bin/perlfect/search 
			directory. Check whether the URLs and paths look correct for your Web site. If 
			you find an error, you can either correct it directly in the configuration file 
			using your editor, or make a note about where the error occurred, and redo the 
			setup from the beginning.</p>
		<p>The default configuration file (conf.pl) enables an option to highlight matches. 
			When enabled, each hit returned on the search results page includes two URLs. 
			One is a link to the actual page where the keyword is found, the other is 
			identified as <em>(highlight matches)</em>, which is a link to the page via a 
			proxy that adds keyword highlighting in the results page. A problem with the 
			result pages that include the highlighting is that the images in the navigation 
			bar are not resolved, and the pages appear to be broken. If you do not want to 
			include highlighted matches in your search results, set <code>$HIGHLIGHT_MATCHES = 
				0;</code> in the conf.pl file.</p>
		<h2>Adding Search to Your Web Site</h2>
		<p>Once you complete the installation and index your site, your next step is to 
			validate that the search engine functions correctly. If you installed Perlfect 
			Search in cgi-bin/perlfect/search, enter the following address in your browser:</p>
		<pre>
    http://myIntranet/cgi-bin/perlfect/search/search.pl
</pre>
		<p>Of course, you need to replace myIntranet with your site domain name, and if 
			your CGI directory uses a different name, or is in a different location, you 
			also need to adjust that part of the URL. Your browser should return a page 
			that includes a search text box and the Perlfect Solutions copyright notice.</p>
		<p>If you know a term that is included among the pages you indexed, you can enter 
			that term, click search, and a page with a ranked list of search hits is 
			returned.</p>
		<p><strong>Note: </strong>If searching for a term produces an error, refer to the 
			README file in the Perlfect Search distribution directory, or refer to the 
			Perlfect Search FAQs on the Perlfect Solutions Web site.</p>
		<p>If you want to add a search text box to your Web site, you can enter the 
			following HTML code in a text file, and save it as searchform.html.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;OpenAccess Search&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;base target="main"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method="get" action="/cgi-bin/perlfect/search/search.pl"&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" name="p" value="1"&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" name="lang" value="en"&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" name="include" value=""&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" name="exclude" value=""&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" name="penalty" value="0"&gt;
	&lt;select name="mode"&gt;
	  &lt;option value="all"&gt;Match ALL words&lt;/option&gt;
	  &lt;option value="any"&gt;Match ANY word&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;/select&gt;
	&lt;input type="text" name="q"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Search"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose &lt;em&gt;Match ALL words&lt;/em&gt; to find pages containing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;em&gt; the specified words  
(though not necessarily together in the same string).&lt;br&gt;
Prefix a word with + to find only those pages that include the word.&lt;br&gt;
Prefix a word with - to find only those pages that do not include the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
		<p>The form input variables affect search results and serve the following purposes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>p</strong>
			An internal variable that should not be changed.
			<li>
				<strong>lang</strong> The language attribute, which uses <em>en</em>
			for English.
			<li>
				<strong>include</strong>
			Limits the search to paths that include the specified string. Null means search 
			all paths in the search index.
			<li>
				<strong>exclude</strong>
			Identifies files to exclude from the search. Null means exclude no files in the 
			search index.
			<li>
				<strong>penalty</strong>
			Controls ranking of search results by using a page's last modified attribute.
			<li>
				<strong>mode</strong> Sets the default operator that determines whether 
				multiple terms are searched by logically AND-ing them (All) or logically OR-ing 
				them (Any). + and - can still be appended by users to control the mode.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For additional details about the form variables, refer to the README file in the 
			Perlfect Search distribution directory.</p>
		<h2>Enhancing Your Search Implementation</h2>
		<p>There are a variety of ways you can configure your Web site to include search. 
			One approach that does not require modifying each page on your site uses a 
			frameset to encapsulate the OpenAccess pages. While this approach has the 
			advantage of not requiring modification of each page on your site, framesets 
			can have disadvantages dependent on how you implement them. This example 
			provides a basic framework that demonstrates one way to incorporate search 
			without modifying every page on your Web site.</p>
		<p>The following HTML defines a two-row frameset with the search text box in the 
			top frame and the starting page and search results displayed in the bottom 
			frame. Adjust the URLs for your site, and save this in a text file as 
			search.html. When this file and the searchform.html file listed above are 
			included in the same directory on your Web site, you can open search.html in 
			your browser, enter a search word or phrase in the top frame, and view search 
			results in the bottom frame—all from a single browser window.</p>
		<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD 
HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd"&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Perlfect

         "http://myserver/cgi-bin/perlfect/search/search.pl"&gt;Left search frame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a
         href= "http://myserver/doc_oa22/oa/html/index.html"&gt;Right frame displays site documents&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/noframes&gt;
&lt;/frameset&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
		<p>Perlfect Search has provisions for limiting the files and directories that are 
			searched and for further customization of the search solution. Be sure to read 
			the README file in your Perlfect Search distribution directory for details, and 
			visit the <a href="http://www.perlfect.com/freescripts/search/">Perlfect Solutions 				Web site</a> for FAQs, detailed installation and configuration 
			instructions, and troubleshooting tips.</p>
