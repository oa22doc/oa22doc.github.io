<h1>Design Database Package (oaDB)</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Design databases, also known as cellView databases, contain various types 
of data that represent portions of hierarchical designs. Types of data 
include:</p>

<div class="indent">
<table border=0 cellpadding=8 summary="&nbsp;">
<tr>
<td>Logical data</td>
<td>Instances indicate the design hierarchy; nets and terminals indicate the 
intended connectivity of the objects of the instances in the design</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Geometric data</td>
<td>Objects have coordinates on them and can be drawn directly by an appropriate 
graphical viewing program</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Routes</td>
<td>Provide a detailed description of the routed wires in a design</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Floorplanning data</td>
<td>Indicates where instances are to be placed and wires are to be run on the chip 
floorplan</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Markers</td>
<td>Flag design rule violations back to designers</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Parasitics</td>
<td>Provide an electrical model of the wires in the design to use for circuit 
analysis</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Properties and Groups</td>
<td>Properties can be attached to any objects in a cellView database to add 
named, application-assigned information to an object; all objects can be 
placed into groups</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>


<h2 class="spabove"><a name="1">Types of Stored Databases</a></h2>

<p>There are several types of database information that can be stored in 
OpenAccess databases. Some of the most common are netlists, schematics, and 
layouts. These are very different kinds of data, in some respects, yet the 
tool uses the same set of objects to represent these data types. For example, 
the meaning of a <em>shape</em> in the database is different for the schematics 
and layout data types: in schematics, it is simply making a drawing; in 
layout, it is actually defining how you build the chip.</p>

<p>The following table shows the differences and similarities between these 
database types.</p>


<table border=1 cellpadding=8 summary="&nbsp;">
<tr>
<th>Netlists</th>
<th>Schematics</th>
<th>Layouts</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Nets can be multi-bit</td>
<td>Nets can be multi-bit</td>
<td>All nets are single-bit</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>There are no shapes</td>
<td>Shapes are primarily for documentation purposes</td>
<td>Most shapes show exactly how to create the chip</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cannot be directly drawn</td>
<td>Efficiently expresses the logic</td>
<td>Hard to interpret visually</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>No layers</td>
<td>Layers are used to help draw interesting variants</td>
<td>Many layers reflect chip process layers</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2 class="spabove"><a name="2">Categories of Objects in CellViews</a></h2>

<p>The following categories of objects can be used within cellViews:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#3">Instances</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Connectivity</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Figures</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Shapes</a></li>
<li><a href="#7">Routes</a></li>
<li><a href="#8">Vias</a></li>
<li><a href="#9">Pins and Instance Pins</a></li>
<li><a href="#10">Markers</a></li>
<li><a href="#11">Parasitics</a></li>
<li><a href="#12">Scan chains</a></li>
<li><a href="#13">Floorplanning Objects</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="3">Instances</a></h3>

<p>Instances are represented with the <a href="../design/classoaInst.html"><code>oaInst</code></a> class and its subclasses. An instance represents the 
inclusion of one cellView as a part of the contents of another. The cellView 
containing the instance is the <em>parent</em> cellView. The cellView that is 
included is the <em>master</em> cellView of the instance.</p>

<p>Instances can create hierarchical designs. The master of an instance can, 
in turn, contain instances of other masters. This hierarchy can continue for 
as many levels as needed to express a complete design. For example, instances 
can include instances of major blocks of a design or individual standard 
cells, or any other components for which a cellView is available.</p>

<p>Instances can also be used to represent complex pin figures. These are 
often used in schematics where a shape more complicated than a polygon is 
desired.</p>

<p>Instances always have an <a href="../design/classoaInstHeader.html"><code>oaInstHeader</code></a>. The InstHeader contains the attributes that 
are constant for all instances of a given master cellView.</p>

<p>Instances of pCells refer to a set of parameters values that are used to 
tailor the pCell for each specific instance.</p><br />


<p>The <a href="../design/classoaInst.html"><code>oaInst</code></a> class is a base 
class for more specific types of instances.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../design/classoaScalarInst.html"><code>oaScalarInst</code></a> 
represents instances that have a scalar name without a bit index and that 
represent a single instance of the included cellView</li>

<li><a href="../design/classoaVectorInst.html"><code>oaVectorInst</code></a> 
represents instances that have bit indices and that represent multiple copies 
of the included cellview</li>

<li><a href="../design/classoaArrayInst.html"><code>oaArrayInst</code></a> represents
instances for which the geometry of the included cellView is repeated multiple 
times in a two-dimensional array. This type of instance is not commonly used; 
when present, this class is typically used for memories</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="spabove"><a name="4">Connectivity</a></h3>

<p>The connections between instances in a design are represented by the 
<a href="../design/classoaNet.html"><code>oaNet</code></a> class. Nets represent the 
logical connectivity in the design. Nets connect to terminals, which are the 
logical connection points that are used by higher-level instances of the net's 
cellView. Nets also connect to instTerms that represent connections to the 
lower-level instances in the net's cellView.</p><br>

<p>The <a href="../design/classoaNet.html"><code>oaNet</code></a> class is a base 
class for more specific types of nets:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../design/classoaScalarNet.html"><code>oaScalarNet</code></a> represents
single-bit nets that do not have a bit index associated with them</li>

<li><a href="../design/classoaBusNet.html"><code>oaBusNet</code></a> represents nets 
that have a bit range associated with them</li>

<li><a href="../design/classoaBundleNet.html"><code>oaBundleNet</code></a> represents
a multi-bit net composed of one or more oaScalarNets, one or more oaBusNets, 
or a combination of oaScalarNets and oaBusNets.</li>
</ul>

<p>When nets are connected externally to a given cellView by higher-level 
parts of the design, they are connected to terminals, which are represented 
by the <a href="../design/classoaTerm.html"><code>oaTerm</code></a> class.</p><br />

<p><a href="../design/classoaTerm.html"><code>oaTerm</code></a> is also a base class 
for more specific types of terminals:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../design/classoaScalarTerm.html"><code>oaScalarTerm</code></a> 
represents single-bit terminals that do not have a bit index associated with 
them</li>

<li><a href="../design/classoaBusTerm.html"><code>oaBusTerm</code></a> represents
a vector terminal</li>

<li><a href="../design/classoaBundleTerm.html"><code>oaBundleTerm</code></a> 
represents a multi-bit terminal composed of one or more oaScalarTerms, one 
or more oaBusTerms, or a combination of oaScalarTerms and oaBusTerms</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="../design/classoaInstTerm.html"><code>oaInstTerm</code></a> objects
can be created on an instance to correspond to terminals in the master cellView
of the instance.
<a href="../design/classoaInstTerm.html"><code>oaInstTerm</code></a> objects can also
be created with terminal names rather than
<a href="../design/classoaTerm.html"><code>oaTerm</code></a> objects. When an
instTerm is created by name, a terminal with that name does not need to exist
at that time on the master. When such an InstTerm is created, it is unbound. If
the master changes at some point to have a terminal with the specified name,
the instTerm can be bound in future uses of that master.</p>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="5">Figures</a></h3>

<p>There are a number of different classes in the cellView database that 
represent geometric objects that have coordinates.</p>

<p><a href="../design/classoaFig.html"><code>oaFig</code></a> is the base class from
which all geometric objects are derived. Some examples of geometric objects 
are shapes, instances, and routes.</p>

<p>All figures have a <em>bounding box</em>, which is the smallest rectangle 
that contains all of the figure's geometry.</p>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="6">Shapes</a></h3>

<p>Shapes are primitive geometric objects that can be used to create elements
of the design. All shapes occupy a particular layer and purpose in the 
database.</p>

<p>The following shapes are used in the OpenAccess database.</p>

<div class="indent">
<table border=0 cellpadding=5 summary="&nbsp;">

<tr>
<td width=120><a href="../design/classoaArc.html"><code>oaArc</code></a></td>
<td>A portion of an ellipse or circle</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="../design/classoaDonut.html"><code>oaDonut</code></a></td>
<td>A circle with a hole</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="../design/classoaDot.html"><code>oaDot</code></a></td>
<td>A small shape in a particular location in the database</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="../design/classoaEllipse.html"><code>oaEllipse</code></a></td>
<td>An ellipse or circle that has no width</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="../design/classoaLine.html"><code>oaLine</code></a></td>
<td>A connected sequence of lines that have no width</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="../design/classoaPath.html"><code>oaPath</code></a></td>
<td>A sequence of connected line segments with specific controls over 
	their width and how the ends of each line segment overlap</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="../design/classoaPolygon.html"><code>oaPolygon</code></a></td>
<td>An arbitrary, multi-sided shape</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="../design/classoaText.html"><code>oaText</code></a></td>
<td>Creates labels in a design of any font or orientation</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="../design/classoaTextDisplay.html"><code>oaTextDisplay</code></a></td>
<td>Similar to <code class="red">oaText</code>, but provides an interface 
that allows the string to be a variable function of design data</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="7">Routes</a></h3>

<p>Routes are objects that are specially designed to represent routed wires 
in a layout. A route can represent both globally routed wires and wires that
have a detailed route. Routes represent all the parts of a wire on every 
layer and contain the vias that connect the wire between layers.</p>

<p>Each route object represents one connected part of a net's routing. A route 
has one begin point and one end point. A complete net commonly has several
different routes on it. Any place a net branches, it requires different routes 
to represent each part of the net that comes into that branch. Branch points 
in the net's routing are represented by objects called 
<a href="../design/classoaSteiner.html"><code>oaSteiner</code></a><code>s</code> that 
help callers understand how the different routes that make up a net are 
interconnected.</p>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="8">Vias</a></h3>

<p>Vias are design objects on chip design layouts that connect routing where 
it changes layers on the chip. Instances of vias can only occur where they 
are referenced by routes. Vias are accessed through the routes that include 
them.</p>

<p>There are two primary ways of creating vias. Custom vias have a stored cellView that contains the vias' detailed geometry. Standard vias use a set of built-in parameters that define all the common ways of building vias. Each type of via used in a given cellView has an 
<a href="../design/classoaViaHeader.html"><code>oaViaHeader</code></a> that 
represents information about that type. The <a href="../design/classoaViaHeader.html"><code>oaViaHeader</code></a> refers to an <a href="../tech/classoaViaDef.html"><code>oaViaDef</code></a>. All of the types of vias available in a given design 
technology have an associated <a href="../tech/classoaViaDef.html"><code>oaViaDef</code></a>. The <a href="../tech/classoaViaDef.html"><code>oaViaDef</code></a> class is stored in the technology database. 
The viaHeader refers to the master cellview with the contents of the via. Custom via masters can be  parameterized cells.</p>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="9">Pins and Instance Pins</a></h3>

<p>Pins are the physical geometry that implements a terminal. Each terminal
can have multiple pins. Each pin has a figure that represents its detailed
geometry. That figure can be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a shape</li>
<li>a route (often used when the pin is actually implemented as a via)</li>
<li>an instance where a more complex set of geometry is required (only used in schematics)</li>
</ul>

<p>InstPins are to pins as instTerms are to terminals. When an instance of a 
cellView with pins is created, the caller can create an 
<a href="../classoaInstPin.html"><code>oaInstPin</code></a><code>s</code>
to which the nets in the parent cellview can connect.</p>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="10">Markers</a></h3>

<p>Markers can be added to a cellView to guide a graphical viewing program.
Markers represent design rule violations or other areas of concern on the 
chip that should be brought to the attention of the designer.</p>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="11">Parasitics</a></h3>

<p>Parasitics are collections of objects that represent various types of 
electrical models of nets in a design. There are several categories of 
parasitics:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Reduced</em> parasitics represent a simplified model of the electrical 
view of the net that can be used for quicker delay calculations</li>

<li><em>Distributed</em> parasitics are an arbitrary network of resistors, 
capacitors, and inductors that represent a very detailed model of the net</li>

<li><em>Cross-coupling</em> parasitics represent the capacitance and inductance between 
different nets in a design</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="12">Scan Chains</a></h3>

<p>The OpenAccess database has specific objects that represent scan chains. 
These objects can represent the inputs and outputs of the scan chain plus the 
inputs and outputs of the scan latches in the design to be hooked into the 
scan chain. Scan chain sets can also represent different scan sets within a 
single design.</p>


<h3 class="spabove"><a name="13">Floorplanning Objects</a></h3>

<p>There are a variety of objects used to represent floorplans for a chip. 
These include:</p>


<ul>
<li><em>Gcell grids</em> are used to run the global routing</li>

<li><em>Track patterns</em> layout the exact locations that detailed routing
can use to route wires</li>

<li><em>Sites</em> indicate the locations where standard cells can be 
placed</li>

<li><em>Boundaries</em> that represent regions that are allocated on a chip for various purposes</li>
</ul>
