<div class="Header2"><a name="p056_features"></a>Changes and New Features</div>
<h4>Region Query Change </h4>
<p>The  oaRegionQuery::getCurrentRegion() function has been updated. In previous versions,   the returned bBox was based on the specified query region and   the current transform. It is now based on the intersection of the specified query region and an instance box in   the hierarchy. </p>
<p>For example, assume an instance lies completely   within the query region. When the query is producing objects in the master,    the master's bBox is used as the current region. </p>
<h4>oaLefDef API Changes (for Derived LEF Translators)</h4>
<p>Derived   translators that use the LefDefIn::checkValidDB function (and  related setValue   functions), must now pass in a message string to indicate what is being   modified. This message string is  used only in the error messages that are output when the technology   database is not writable or is not the most derived technology database.</p>
<p>The DefOutOptions class has a new  checkCellType option. When set to true, only instances for which the master design has an oaCellType other than oacNoCellType or oacViaCellType are output to the DEF file.</p>
<h4>Optionally Building LEF/DEF Translators </h4>
<p>If you need to build the LEF/DEF translators (which is optional), the lefdef05.70-s001 (or later) kits are now required.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="../html/guide/compat.html">Compatibility for OpenAccess Applications and Data</a> for more information about <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> and <em>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</em> changes. </p>
<h4>Tcl Bindings for the OpenAccess API </h4>
<p>Applications compiled   with oaTcl header files prior to 2.2.6-p052 need to be recompiled with release 2.2.6-p052 or   later. For more information, refer to <a href="../html/Tcl/index.html#limitations">Limitations</a> in <em>Tcl Bindings for the OpenAccess API</em> for more information.</p>
<div class="Header2"><a name="227_features"></a>Changes and New Features</div>
<h4>LEF 5.7 Support</h4>
<p>The <code>lef2oa</code> and <code>oa2lef</code> translators now partially support LEF 5.7. Any LEF 5.7 constructs that have corresponding OpenAccess built-in constraints are mapped to those   constraints. LEF 5.7 constructs that do not currently map to built-in constraints result in warnings in the translators. Refer to the <a href="../html/oa2lefdefmap/index.html">LEF/DEF to OpenAccess Mapping</a> documentation for  information mapped constructs. </p>
<p>The <code>lef2oa</code> translator determines the LEF version based on the input file. The <code>oa2lef</code> translator has a <code>-ver</code> option for specifying the output version. </p>
<h4>LEF/DEF Mapping </h4>
<p>The mapping for the LEF LAYER SPACING attribute with two RANGE keywords has been fixed to also incorporate values from the SPACING attribute with a single RANGE keyword. </p>
<h4>oaStrm API Addition (for Derived Stream Translators)</h4>
<p>Derived translators can use StrmOut::getTextNS to access the translator namespace in order to write additional labels. Also, functions were added to oaStrm to allow the manipulation of text and statistics. </p>
<h4>Supported Platforms and Compilers for OpenAccess Pre-Compiled Libraries</h4>
<p>The Itanium Linux platform (AS 2.1) is no longer supported. </p>
<h4>Building OpenAccess on Windows </h4>
<p>You can now use&nbsp;Microsoft  Visual Studio 2005&nbsp;as well  Visual Studio .NET 2003&nbsp;to compile your environment on Windows. The OpenAccess solution files  for Visual Studio 2005 have a &nbsp;_vc8 extension in their name.   For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>oaDynamic.sln is for Visual Studio .NET   2003</li>
  <li>oaDynamic_vc8.sln is for Visual Studio   2005</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <a href="install.html#windows_config">Optionally Compiling on the Windows Platform</a> for more information. </p>
<h4>Optionally Building LEF/DEF Translators </h4>
<p>If you need to build the LEF/DEF translators (which is optional), the lefdef5.7 (or later) kits are now required.</p>

<p>The current <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> is 3. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Huge Database feature was introduced in <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> 1.</li>
  <li>New constraints and oaFigGroups were introduced in <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> 2.</li>
  <li>Incremental technology databases were introduced in <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>New functions were added to this release, so the <em>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</em> was incremented to 33. Programs compiled with the header files in the P048 release <em> or later</em> cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from versions prior to P048. Programs compiled with versions prior to P048 will continue to run unchanged with the shared libraries produced from the current release.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="../html/guide/compat.html">Compatibility for OpenAccess Applications and Data</a> for more information. In addition, refer to  the <a href="feature_table.html">Features by Data Model</a> for a list of the features included in each version of OpenAccess. </p>
<h4>Potential  oaAppDef Issue Resolved</h4>
<p>Persistent application-defined data (oaAppDef data) created using versions of OpenAccess  between 2.2.3 and  P048 (inclusive) might be corrupted. The OpenAccess P049 release contains code to automatically repair the corruption in most cases. </p>
<p>In the  problematic window (between 2.2.3 and P048 inclusive), an application reading an OpenAccess  database using  OpenAccess shared libraries that were newer than the OpenAccess shared libraries  used to create the database could crash when performing the following actions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Deleting objects that were referred  to by oaInterPointerAppDefs</li>
  <li> Attempting to traverse pointers stored in  oaInterPointerAppDefs if one of the following was true:
    <ul>
        <li>The object pointed to by the  oaInterPointerAppDef was an oaAppObject.</li>
      <li>The object that owns the  oaInterPointerAppDef was an oaAppObject.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This issue was more prevalent in oaTech databases. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though the P049 release contains code to repair the corruption, there are  rare cases in which the repair process  fails. If the database cannot be repaired, and the repair process failed on oaAppDef data that the application explicitly registered, an <em>oacCannotRepairCorruptedAppData</em> exception is thrown when the database is opened (regardless of mode). Because any application can use oaAppDefs to define persistent application-specific data, the exception is not thrown unless the   application reading the database explicitly registered an oaAppObjectDef for an   oaAppObject that contains un-repairable   oaAppData. This means that applications can still read the database, even if some portions of it are not repairable, if they do not attempt to access the un-repairable portions. </p>
<div class="Header2"><a name="p048_features" id="p048_features"></a>Changes and New Features</div>
<div class="Header3">Technology Databases</div>

<h4>Enhanced   Model for Technology Database Attributes </h4>
<p>In previous releases, OpenAccess reported a conflict if the default value of a technology attribute, such as DBUPerUU, conflicted with a user-specified value for the same technology attribute in a graph of incremental technology databases. <span class="style1"></span>Now OpenAccess can distinguish between explicitly set values and implicitly assigned default values. In a graph of technology databases, an explicitly set attribute value takes precedence over any implicitly assigned value, and there is not a conflict if they differ. </p>
<p>For more information, refer to <a href="../html/guide/tech.html#tech_attr_conflict">Technology Database Attributes</a> in the <em>Programmers Guide</em>.</p>
<h4>oaTech::setRefs Prevents Circular References </h4>
<p>In previous releases, it was possible to create a circular set of technology database references  with oaTech::setRefs. For example:</p>
<pre><img src="images/circularTechChain.gif" width="316" height="266" /></pre>
<p>An  oacTechSetRefsCircularReference exception is now thrown if an application attempts to create a circular set of references.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The oacTechCannotSetRefToSelf  message (&quot;Cannot set self as reference&quot;,) has been obsoleted because the functionality is now part of oacTechSetRefsCircularReference. </p>
<h4>oaObserver&lt;oaTech&gt; Changes </h4>
<p>In   previous releases, the oaObserver&lt;oaTech&gt;::onFirstOpen  and  oaObserver&lt;oaTech&gt;::onPostOpenRefs observers were   invoked after   checks for conflicts and for unbound technology database references. These two observers are now invoked before the checks. Accordingly, the   oaObserver&lt;oaTech&gt;::onConflict and oaObserver&lt;oaTech&gt;::onUnboundRef   observers now appear after the onFirstOpen and onPostOpenRefs observers. </p>
<p>In previous releases, the oaObserver&lt;oaTech&gt;::onPurge observer was invoked after the graph of incremental technology databases was destroyed. This observer is now invoked before the graph of incremental technology databases is destroyed. Accordingly, the  onModify observers for the oacUnbind<em>&lt;objectHeader&gt;</em>ModType now appear before the onPurge observer notification.</p>
<div class="Header3">New Design Management (DM) Attribute for Read-Only Reference Libraries</div>
<p>The  Turbo and FileSys DM systems have a new attribute that can be set on read-only reference libraries to indicate that OpenAccess can always perform partial reading of the data.</p>
<table width="738" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="141" valign="top">&quot;libReadOnly&quot;</td>
    <td width="581"> 	

      <p> 	

Specifies whether or not applications can modify the library and its contents. This attribute can be set to "yes" to indicate that the library is a read-only reference library. If set to "yes", OpenAccess is always able to perform partial reading of the data, which can improve performance.</p>
      <p>If set to “no” (the default), and the library is being accessed across an NFS or AFS network, and the file system permissions prevent OpenAccess from modifying the library, OpenAccess will read database files completely into memory when they are first accessed.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>There are two new exceptions related to the new DM attribute:</p>
<ul>
  <li>oacNoWriteAccessOnReadOnlyLib is thrown when an application attempts to get write access on a library  whose  <em>libReadOnly</em>   attribute is set to yes. <br />
  </li>
  <li>oacCannotDestroyObjectWithCacheActive is thrown when an application attempts to destroy a DM object (oaDMFile, oaCell, oaCellView, or oaView) that has active caches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  In previous releases,  problems could occur when multiple users on NFS accessed the same libraries. Specifically, if a process partially read a file and left the file open, then another process wrote to that file, the reader would encounter problems on attempting to read the file again. This problem has been resolved. </p>
<div class="Header3">Translator Changes </div>

<h4>oa2strm Translator Changes</h4>
<p>The <code>oa2strm</code> translator has new options for adding pin text (labels) to nets and terminals. In addition, there is a new option to specify the Stream format for the output file, and a new <code></code> option  that lets you convert path objects to polygons.</p>

<h4>lef2oa Translator Change</h4>
<p>The <code>lef2oa</code> translator issues a warning and does not use the new attribute value if the manufacturing grid or clearance measure values in the file being imported are different than the values already in the database. In previous releases, an error message was issued.</p>
<h4>oa2verilog Can Map All tieLow or tieHigh Nets </h4>

<h3>LEF/DEF API Changes </h3>
<p>The openTech function has been removed from LefIn 
  because it was redundant with initTechDBLocal, which provides the same functionality. </p>
<h4>Optionally Building lef2oa or oa2lef </h4>
<p>If you need to build the LEF translators (which is optional), the <code></code><code>lefdefInt05.60-s024</code> kits are now required.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="install.html">OpenAccess Installation and Configuration Notes</a> for more information about building the translators.</p>
<div class="Header3">&nbsp;New Classes and Functions </div>
<h4>New oaAnalysisPointArray Class</h4>
<p>The <a href="../html/design/classoaAnalysisPointArray.html">oaAnalysisPointArray</a> class implements a utility array class used to pass an array of oaAnalysisPoint class pointers to the following function:</p>
<pre>
oaParasiticNetwork* oaParasiticNetwork::create(oaDesignObject*                 net,
                                               const oaAnalysisPointArray&amp;     aps)  	</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following function is considered deprecated:</p>
<pre>
oaParasiticNetwork* oaParasiticNetwork::create(oaDesignObject    *net, 
                                               oaUInt4           numAPs, 
                                               oaAnalysisPoint   **aps) </pre>
<h4>New oaBuildInfoArray Class</h4>
<p>The <a href="../html/base/classoaBuildInfoArray.html">oaBuildInfoArray</a> class implements a utility array class used to pass an array of oaBuildInfo pointers back to the user with the following function:</p>
<pre>void oaBuildInfo::getPackages(oaBuildInfoArray&amp;    packagesIn)</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following function is considered deprecated:</p>
<pre>oaBuildInfo** oaBuildInfo::getPackages()</pre>
<h4>New oaMemoryError Class</h4>
<p>The new <a href="../html/base/classoaMemoryError.html">oaMemoryError</a> class contains information about the exception that OpenAccess throws when it detects that a process is out of memory when oaMemory::get() or oaMemory::resize() are called. This allows an application to print a  more helpful message when this error occurs.</p>
<div class="Header3">Performance Speed Up </div>
<p>The implementation of   const APIs that do not modify the database, such as oaInstTerm::getInst() and oaTech::getDBUPerUU(), has been modified to improve performance. The const APIs   in the optimized shared libraries no longer validate their arguments (including   the <em>this</em> pointer). The non-const APIs that do modify the database, such as oaInstTerm::create() and oaTech::setDBUPerUU(),  continue to validate their arguments as   before. </p>
<p>Both the   const and non-const APIs continue to validate their arguments and throw exceptions when appropriate in the debuggable shared   libraries. However,  instead of throwing exceptions, these APIs will generate crashes when the optimized libraries are used. </p>
<p> Applications must <em>not</em> rely on OpenAccess to validate arguments in   the const APIs. &nbsp;Application developers should develop and test their   applications using the debuggable shared libraries,  then use the optimized   shared libraries when testing for release and when shipping.</p>
<div class="Header3">OpenAccess Tcl Bindings</div>
<p>The  <a href="../html/Tcl/index.html">Tcl Bindings for the   OpenAccess API</a> document has been improved and includes new  usage examples. </p>
<h3>oaTcl API Interfaces</h3>
<p>New oaTcl interfaces are provided for the following:</p>
<pre>
::oa::AnalysisPointArray
::oa::BuildInfoArray </pre>
<p>The following oaTcl interfaces, which do not correspond to  public OpenAccess APIs, have been removed. </p>

<div class="Header3">OpenAccess Examples </div>
<p>The OpenAccess programming examples in <code><em>&lt;install_dir&gt;</em>/examples/oa</code> have been improved. Each example directory now contains a <code>run</code> script, which  creates any  demo data (if needed), and runs the example. Each example directory also includes a <code>log.ref </code> file that contains the expected output.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to <a href="../html/guide/apipkgs.html#examples">API Programming Examples</a>.</p>
<div class="Header3">&nbsp;Improved Error Messages</div>
<p> The error and warning messages for the SPEF, Stream, and Verilog translators have been improved. Errors messages now help identify the cause of an error and  suggest a corrective action. All messages are output with a unique alphanumeric prefix to ensure an unambiguous reference. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Error and warning messages for the LEF/DEF translators were  improved in a previous release.</p>

<div class="Header2"><a name="226_status"></a>Release Status</div>
<p>Some parts of this release are still in development and are considered to be of Beta quality. They are subject to changes in their use and interface. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tcl interface</li>
  <li>Wafer database</li>
  <li>Milkyway to OpenAccess Translator</li>
  <li>Turbo DM System</li>
  <li>Tcl Pcells</li>
  <li>DM interface used by plug-in developers </li>
</ul>
<p>The oaPcellScript Plug-In is in development and is not ready for use at this time. </p>
<div class="Header2"><a name="feature_compat"></a>Feature-Based Data Compatibility </div>
<p>OpenAccess  includes a new infrastructure to support data compatibility.   Data compatibility addresses whether or not the databases written by applications built on  one version of OpenAccess can be read or modified by applications using  a different version of OpenAccess. In particular, newer OpenAccess  releases can include features that have associated data that is not  understood by previous versions of OpenAccess. </p>
<p>OpenAccess now provides feature-based data compatibility,  which means that new features can be added to OpenAccess in a way that  continues to allow newer releases of OpenAccess to be used by older  applications. </p>
<p>For example, OpenAccess 2.2.6 includes a new feature called incremental technology databases. This new features allows a design database to reference more than one technology database. Because this means that a new kind of data  is added to the data model, the incremental technology database capability is considered  a <em>feature</em>. When a database  contains one or more instances of this new kind of data,  it considered to be using that feature. In many cases, older applications will not be able  to use databases that have new features. </p>
<p>When OpenAccess releases a new feature, it increments the data model revision number (<em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em>).</p>
<p>OpenAccess has the ability to control the access that an  application has to an OpenAccess database based on </p>
<ul>
  <li>The version of OpenAccess that the application supports </li>
  <li> The new features  used in that database</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, OpenAccess allows the applications in a flow to specify their level of support for new features when importing data with the OpenAccess translators. </p>
<p>For information about how an application can use feature-based compatibility, refer to <a href="../html/guide/compat.html">Compatibility for OpenAccess Applications and Data</a>.</p>
<div class="Header2"><a name="226_up_compat"></a>Compatibility with Earlier Releases</div>
<p>The current <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> is 3. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Huge Database feature was introduced in <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> 1.</li>
  <li>New constraints and oaFigGroups were introduced in <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> 2.</li>
  <li>Incremental technology databases were introduced in <em>oacDataModelRevNumber</em> 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>New functions were added to this release, so the <EM>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</EM> was incremented to 30. Programs compiled with the header files in 2.2.6 <EM> or later</EM> cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from versions prior to 2.2.6. Programs compiled with versions prior to 2.2.6 will continue to run unchanged with the shared libraries in the current release.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="../html/guide/compat.html">Compatibility for OpenAccess Applications and Data</a> for more information. In addition, refer to  the <a href="feature_table.html">Features by Data Model</a> for a list of the features included in each version of OpenAccess. </p>
<h4>Reference to vector Removed from oaCommonTypes.h </h4>
<p>The following statement has been removed from the  oaCommonTypes.h file:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;vector></pre>
<p>As a result, you might encounter compilation errors because the class std::vector is no longer defined. To resolve this, add this include statement at the appropriate location in one of your own header files.</p>
<div class="Header2"><a name="226_features"></a>Changes and New Features</div>
<p>OpenAccess 2.2.6 includes three new features in the context of feature-based compatibility (as describe above). </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#inc_tech">New Incremental Technology Databases</a> (released as a single feature in data model 3)</li>
  <li><a href="#figGroup">New oaFigGroup Object</a> (released as two features in data model 2)</li>
  <li><a href="#constraints">New Constraints for 65 Nanometer and Custom Designs and Enhanced Derived Layer Support</a> (released as a set of features in data model 2)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="style10"><strong>Important: </strong></span>Applications that support data model 2 or 3 <strong>must</strong> modify their code to handle these new features. In the sections that follow, guidelines for the needed modification are called out for each of the three new features. </p>
<p>More  information about these features is available in the <a href="feature_table.html">Features by Data Model</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, this release includes numerous enhancements and fixes that do not affect the data model:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#textPlug">New Text bBox Plug-in Architecture</a></li>
  <li><a href="#defConstraints">New Default Constraint Groups</a></li>

  <li><a href="#techAttach">New oaTech Attachment Functions</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="Header3"><a name="tech_overview"></a>Technology Databases</div>
<p>This release of OpenAccess includes support for using multiple technology databases (oaTechs) for a single design. </p>
<p>In addition, this release includes enhancements to existing code to consistently handle any failures related to the bindings between oaDesign and oaTech databases. </p>
<p> Finally, a new gateGrounded attribute on oaTech returns a boolean value  indicating whether or not the gates are considered grounded in this  technology database. </p>
<h4><a name="inc_tech"></a>New Incremental Technology Databases </h4>
<p>Applications can now use incremental technology databases to provide technology information from multiple sources, such as the foundry, an IP provider, or a designer, to the application at different points in the design cycle. OpenAccess lets applications incrementally assemble technology information by creating references from one oaTech database to other oaTech databases. </p>
<p>For more information, refer to <a href="../html/guide/tech.html#inc">Incremental Technology Databases</a> in <em>Using Technology Databases</em> in the Programmers Guide. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is currently a known issue when using built-in constraint groups across incremental technology databases. Refer to <a href="kpns.html">Known Problems and Solutions</a> for details. </p>
<h5>Modifying Your Code to Use this Feature</h5>
<p>Most  applications based on OpenAccess need access to the technology database.  For example, any application that examines graphical data must access layers and via definitions.  Applications reading technology databases might encounter incrementally defined databases.  This requires defining observers to detect and report conflicts that can occur when a technology database is edited out of context of a larger graph in which it is used. The <a href="../html/guide/helloworld.html">HelloWorld Example</a> contains sample code that creates such observers. </p>
<p>In addition, applications that use technology objects must be aware that two technology objects referenced from the same design might be defined in different technology databases.  Applications can no longer assume that the technology database containing the technology object in question is the sole technology database for the design. </p>
<p>Finally, when creating a technology object, an application must be prepared to handle the exception thrown if the object it is attempting to create conflicts with another object in the graph of referenced technology databases. </p>
<h4>Binding Between oaDesign and oaTech Databases </h4>
<p>When working with oaDesign and oaTech databases, the most efficient flow is to open and edit the oaTech databases as early as possible, then open the oaDesign databases. </p>
<p>OpenAccess has been enhanced to ensure that any binding failures between oaDesign databases and oaTech databases are handled consistently.</p>
<ul>
  <li> oaDesign functions do not throw any  exceptions related to oaTech open operations or technology object binding operations. </li>
  <li>Null pointers are returned by all design header get&lt;TechObject&gt; functions when the oaTech database or the oaTech object cannot be bound. Null pointers are also returned by oaDesign::getTech() when the oaTech cannot be bound. This applies even if the technology object or database does not exist or cannot be opened.</li>
  <li>oaTech::open() is the only function that throws exceptions if there are problems when opening a technology database. </li>
</ul>
<p>The  sections that follow provide more detailed information about these changes. </p>
<h5>More Proactive Binding Between oaDesign and oaTech Databases</h5>
<p>The binding between oaDesign and oaTech databases is more proactive than in previous OpenAccess releases. When an oaDesign that contains objects that use technology database information (such as vias or rows) is opened, the relevant oaTech database is always opened and bound if possible. All dependent objects are bound as well. </p>
<h5><strong>Design Objects That Reference oaTech Objects </strong></h5>
<p>When creating a design object that references an oaTech object, a NotInTechAssociatedWithDesign exception is thrown if the referenced oaTech object is not in the technology database to which the design is bound nor in the graph of referenced oaTech databases (if incremental technology databases are used). </p>
<p>For example, the following function throws an oacViaDefNotInTechAssociatedWithDesign exception if the given technology object is not in the technology database to which the design is bound nor in the graph of referenced oaTech databases.</p>
<pre>
oaCustomVia::create(oaBlock              *block,
                    const oaCustomViaDef *viaDef,
                    const oaTransform    &amp;xform,
                    const oaParamArray   *params)</pre>
<p>Other similar cases include:</p>
<pre>
oaStdVia::create()
oaRow::create() 
oaAnalysisOpPoint::create() 
oaPRBoundary::setCoreBoxSpec() 
oaRowHeader::find() 
oaViaHeader::find() </pre>
<p>In previous releases, an oacCannotFindTechForDesign exception was thrown.</p>
<h5>Vias and Via Definitions </h5>
<p>When reading in the vias for a design, OpenAccess attempts to bind the vias to their via definitions. This might require binding the design to its technology database. In previous versions, OpenAccess threw  an exception if the binding failed. Now OpenAccess leaves the oaViaHeaders unbound instead.</p>
<p>In addition, an attempt to bind a via definition to a via of a different data type results in an exception. </p>
<h5>Region Query </h5>
<p>Region query now tolerates cases in which a design cannot be bound to its technology database.</p>
<h5>Moving or Copying Vias</h5>
<p>Copying or moving a via from one design to another does not make sense if doing so  results in binding the via to a different via definition. For example,  when copying a via, the name of the related via definition might refer to an oaStdViaDef in the source oaTech database, but an oaCustomViaDef in the target oaTech database. Previous versions of OpenAccess did not check for this case, which could cause a crash or corrupt the target design.</p>
<p>OpenAccess now verifies that the source and target designs refer to exactly the same via definition (not equivalent ones). An exception is thrown otherwise.</p>
<div class="Header3"><a name="figGroup"></a>New oaFigGroup Object </div>
<p>Graphical design-entry tools can use the new oaFigGroup object to hold a set of figures for easy replication and reuse. An oaFigGroup is purely geometric and does not contain connectivity objects (or anything  that is not a figure). </p>
<p>For more information, refer to the documentation for the following classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../html/design/classoaFigGroup.html">oaFigGroup</a></li>
  <li><a href="../html/design/classoaFigGroupMem.html">oaFigGroupMem</a></li>
  <li><a href="../html/design/classoaFigGroupQuery.html">oaFigGroupQuery</a></li>
  <li><a href="../html/design/classoaFigGroupStatus.html">oaFigGroupStatus</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Modifying Your Code to Use this New Feature</h5>
<p>If your application does not access geometrical data (oaFigs),  the oaFigGroup feature does not affect your application. Queries of oaFigs are unchanged, as oaFigs in oaFigGroups are handled by existing region query calls. If your application uses oaFigs solely to query them, you might not need to handle this feature. </p>
<p>If your application handles the selection of graphical objects, you might want to support selection of oaFigGroups by using the new <a href="../html/design/classoaFigGroupQuery.html">oaRegionQuery</a> class for oaFigGroups.  An oaFigGroup can be a member of an oaGroup, so code that iterates through oaGroups must tolerate the presence of oaFigGroups. </p>
<div class="Header3"><a name="constraints"></a>New Constraints for 65 Nanometer and Custom Designs and Enhanced Derived Layer Support</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The oaSizedLayer class has been deprecated. This type of layer should  be expressed as an oaDerivedLayer. </p>
<h6><a name="derivedLayerDef" id="derivedLayerDef"></a>New Derived Layer Definition</h6>
<p>The oaDerivedLayer class defines a derived layer, which is formed from the combination of two layers and a layer operation.  Refer to the class documentation for <a href="../html/tech/classoaDerivedLayerDef.html">oaDerivedLayerDef</a> for more information.</p>

<h6><a name="layerArrayConstraint" id="layerArrayConstraint"></a>New Layer Array Constraint</h6>
<p>The <a href="../html/tech/classoaLayerArrayConstraint.html">oaLayerArrayConstraint</a> class defines constraints for three or more layers. </p>
<h6><a name="oaValueSubtypes" id="oaValueSubtypes"></a>New oaValue Subtypes</h6>
<p>Four new oaValue subclasses  support new constraints and derived layers:</p>

</ul>
<h4><a name="useConstraints"></a>Modifying Your Code to Use These Features</h4>
<p>If your application does not query for or create constraints or layers, you do not need to modify your code to handle these new features. </p>
<p>If your application does query for or create constraints, you must complete the following tasks. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Modify your code to use the new oaDerivedLayer class instead of the oaSizedLayer class.  When reading in older data that uses oaSizedLayer, update that data to use the new oaDerivedLayer.</li>
  <li>Does your application create constraints on nets or routes that  apply to shapes associated with those objects? If so, modify your code to create the constraints in the new default constraint groups for nets or routes, respectively. Also, if your application searches for these type of constraints, search in the new default constraint groups. <br>
  </li>
  <li> Review the detailed documentation for the new constraints  and modify your application to respect those new constraints if appropriate.  Also ensure that your code can handle the existing constraints with new parameters or value types.  If you created user-defined constraints that replicate the semantics of any of the new constraints, modify your code to update those constraints to the newly defined constraints. </li>
</ul>
<div class="Header3"><a name="textPlug"></a>New Text bBox Plug-in Architecture </div>
<p> OpenAccess now includes a plug-in infrastructure that lets an application  calculate its own bBoxes for text labels. For more information, refer to <a href="../html/guide/textbBox.html">How to Write a Plug-in to Calculate Bounding Boxes for Text</a>.</p>
<h5>Changes to Existing bBox Functionality</h5>
<p>For oaAttrDisplay and oaInstAttrDisplay objects, the OpenAccess native bBox implementation (the default) now calculates the bBoxes based on the oaNativeNS mapped string. In previous versions, the bBoxes were calculated based on strings mapped in the namespace used in previous calls to oaAttrDisplay::getText and oaInstAttrDisplay::getText previously (if any). Otherwise, the oaNativeNS mapped string was used. </p>
<p>If a design has oaInstAttrDisplay, oaInstPropDisplay, or oaTextOverride objects, these objects might become unbound when the design is opened and the master design is not already open. In previous versions, OpenAccess did not check if these objects should be unbound. </p>
<div class="Header3"><a name="extend"></a>Enhanced Documentation on Extending the Database</div>
<p>The OpenAccess documentation has been enhanced to include a list of all classes that can be extended using properties and oaAppDefs. Refer to <a href="../html/guide/extend.html#1a">Which Classes can be Extended</a> in the <em>Programmers Guide</em> for details.</p>
<div class="Header3"><a name="obsImp"></a>Implementation Change for oaObserver</div>
<p>The implementation of the oaObserver class has changed. This change is transparent and applications must continue to use oaObserver as before. This description is provided for informational purposes only. </p>
<p>The oaObserver template class and its specializations have been replaced with the oaVersionedObserver template and corresponding specializations. This template has an additional non-type template argument for the version of the observer. The oaObserver identifier is defined in the header files as oaVersionedObserver. This change was required to add new virtual functions to the specialization of oaTech. Application code must reference oaObserver&#8212;direct reference of oaVersionedObserver is not supported.</p>
<div class="Header3"><a name="globNet"></a>Enhancements to Global Nets </div>
<p>The behavior of OpenAccess APIs with regards to global nets has been enhanced.  The consistency of the global state of a net is now preserved across the OpenAccess hierarchy domains.  This statement has several implications: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Global nets with the same name created in the module domain  result in a single global net in the block domain.  However, there will be no corresponding net in the top module unless it is explicitly created in the top module.  A global net can be created in the top module at any time, regardless of whether or not a global net with the same name was previously created in some other module or in the block. </li>
  <li>All global module nets with the same name are presented as a single global net in the block domain. </li>
  <li>Removing the global state of a net in the block domain removes the global state of every module net with the same name as the global block net.  These module nets  become ordinary local module nets and are presented in the block domain as disjoint block nets. </li>
  <li>Destroying a global net in the block domain  destroys every global module net with the same name as the global block net. </li>
  <li>When a global module net is connected to a local module net through an oaModInstTerm, only the global net is presented in the block domain, but the local module net  remains local.  The connectivity of the global block net includes the block domain reflection of the connectivity of the local module net that it is connected to through the oaInstTerm. <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="Header3"><a name="techAttach"></a>New oaTech Attachment Functions </div>
<p>This release includes new APIs for working with attached technology libraries. An application can now detach a technology database that is currently open for a design and reattach a different one. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using attached technology databases is not the same as using referenced incremental technology databases. Refer to the <a href="../html/tech/classoaTech.html">oaTech</a> class documentation for more information.</p>
<pre>
void oaTech::attach(oaLib              *lib,
		    const oaScalarName &attachLibName
		    ) 


void oaTech::detach(oaLib    *lib) 


oaBoolean oaTech::hasAttachment(const oaLib    *lib) 


void oaTech::getAttachment(const oaLib     *lib,
		           oaScalarName    &attachLibName
	                   ) </pre>
<p>To support  backward data compatibility, the previous mechanism for attaching technology libraries is still supported. Namely,  a string property called techLibName in a library&rsquo;s oaLibDMData database still specifies the name of the target library. The oaTech::attach function creates the techLibName property when it is called. In order to construct the name of the library, the techLibName string is interpreted in the oaNativeNS namespace.</p>
<p>New observers are available for the new APIs.</p>

<div class="Header2"><a name="transChanges"></a>Translator Enhancements </div>
<h4>Support for Incremental Technology Databases</h4>
<p>The <a href="../html/translators/lef2oa.html"><code>lef2oa</code></a>, <a href="../html/translators/def2oa.html"><code>def2oa</code></a>, <a href="../html/stream/streamincmds.html"><code>strm2oa</code></a>, and <a href="../html/verilog/index.html"><code>verilog2oa</code></a> translators can  create   incremental technology databases with the <code>-techRefs</code> option. Refer to the individual translator documentation for more information. </p>
<h5>Using the lef2oa Translator with Incremental Technology Databases </h5>
<p>The <code>lef2oa</code> translator should <em>not</em> add routing layers  or default vias in a derived technology database if one of the referenced technology databases has a LEFDefaultRouteSpec constraint group.</p>
<p>The <code>lef2oa</code> translator  creates an explicitly named   constraint group called <em>LEFDefaultRouteSpec</em> to store information about layers and default vias (VIAs in LEF that   have the DEFAULT keyword). Because a graph of technology databases can  contain only a single   constraint group with that name, <code>lef2oa</code> cannot add or change layers or default vias in   a derived technology database if one of the referenced technology databases already contains the   LEFDefaultRouteSpec constraint group. &nbsp;This is not a problem if the   layer and default via definitions in the LEF input match the definitions in the referenced technology database.</p>
<p>The base technology database hierarchy should contain a full set of layer and default via definitions, and subsequent derived technology databases created by <code>lef2oa</code> should be used only to add sites, via-rules, non-default vias, non-default-rules, and macros.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can create an incomplete base technology database with <code>lef2oa</code>, then add layers and default vias to a derived technology database using <code>lef2oa</code>. You need to remove the LEFDefaultRouteSpec using the OpenAccess Tcl bindings after running the first <code>lef2oa</code> operation. </p>
<h4>lef2oa and oa2lef Translators </h4>
<p>The <code>lef2oa</code> and <code>oa2lef</code> translators now support  LEF 5.6 constructs and create OpenAccess constraints (instead of properties) for these constructs. You must set the <code>-dataModel</code> argument to 3  to enable creation of the LEF 5.6 constraints. Refer to the translator mapping documentation for more information. </p>
<h5>Optionally Building lef2oa or oa2lef </h5>
<p>If you need to build the LEF translators (which is optional), the <code>def_5.6.tar.Z</code> and <code>lef_5.6.tar.Z</code> kits are now required.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="install.html">OpenAccess Installation and Configuration Notes</a> for more information about building the translators. </p>
<h4>def2oa Translator </h4>
<p>The <code>def2oa</code> translator has a new <code>-layerMap</code> option  to specify a layer mapping file. The translator reads the mapping file before looking up 
  layer names in the technology database, which means users can map layer names to existing layer names in the technology database. </p>
<p>Refer to <a href="../html/translators/def2oa.html">DEF to OpenAccess Translator (def2oa)</a> for more information. </p>
<h4>verilogAnnotate Translator</h4>
<p>The <code>verilogAnnotate</code> translator now treats "tristate" as equivalent to "output" for consistency purposes. Ports  declared as "output" in Verilog that have an existing oaTermType of "tristate" retain the "tristate" oaTermType.</p>
<h4>oa2strm Translator</h4>
<p>The <code>oa2strm</code> translator now accepts multiple cell names for translation. </p>
<p>Refer to <a href="../html/stream/streamoutcmds.html">OpenAccess to Stream Translator (oa2strm)</a> for more information. </p>
<h4>Translator API Changes</h4>
<p>The following changes have been made to the translator APIs. Applications that derive from the OpenAccess translators must modify their code accordingly.</p>
<h5>oaStrm    API Changes</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The Stream translator components were  restructured  to handle incremental technology databases.</li>
  <li> The following new functions in the OptionsIn class  support the specification of a library path on the command line:
    <ul>
        <li> getLibPath() const </li>
      <li>setLibPath(const oaString &amp;value)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A library reference is no longer stored in the Structure class. The NameMgr class now handles the mapping between the stream and OpenAccess names. </li>
  <li>The populateLimitMap() function was removed from the StrmIn class. The limit map, as a tool for ensuring that the on-disk representation of a library contains no more than 20000 cells, has been eliminated.  This functionality is now provided through the NameMgr class.</li>
  <li>To support the ability to accept multiple cell names, the OptionsOut::getCellName() and OptionsOut::setCellName() translator functions were updated. </li>
</ul>
<h5> oaLefDef   API Changes</h5>
<p>The  LEF/DEF translator components were  restructured  to    handle incremental technology databases. </p>

<h2><a name="P037_status"></a>Release Status</h2>
<p>Some parts of this release are still in development and are considered to be of Beta quality. They are subject to changes in their use and interface. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tcl interface</li>
  <li>Wafer database</li>
  <li>Milkyway to OpenAccess Translator</li>
  <li>Turbo DM System</li>
  <li>Tcl Pcells</li>
  <li>DM interface used by plug-in developers </li>
</ul>
<p>The oaPcellScript Plug-In is in development and is not ready for use at this time. </p>
<h2><a name="P037_up_compat"></a>Compatibility with Earlier Releases</h2>
<p>New functions were added to this release, so the <EM>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</EM> was incremented to 21. Programs compiled with the header files in 2.2.5 <EM> or later</EM> cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from versions prior to 2.2.5. Programs compiled with versions prior to 2.2.5 will continue to run unchanged with the shared libraries in the current release.</p>
<p>The current <i>oacDataModelRevNumber</i> number is 1. Refer to <a href="../html/guide/compat.html">Compatibility for OpenAccess Applications and Data</a> for more information.</p>
<h2><a name="P037_features"></a>Changes and New Features</h2>
<h4>OpenAccess is Available on the Solaris 10 (x86_64) Operating System </h4>
<p>OpenAccess is available on the solaris operating system 10 (x86_64). The supported compiler is Forte Developer/Studio 11 C++ 5.8.</p>
<h4>Enhancements to Undo and Redo Functionality </h4>
<p>OpenAccess provides  two use models for performing undo and redo operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Post checkpoint model&#8212;Applications set checkpoints after an operation occurs. </li>
  <li>Pre checkpoint model&#8212;Applications set checkpoints before an operation occurs. </li>
</ul>
<p>In previous releases, there was  a potential ambiguity  in the pre checkpoint model. Consider this example:</p>
<p><img src="images/undo.gif" width="342" height="289"> </p>
<p>If an application issued an undo command after setting checkpoint 3, the expectation might be that checkpoint 3 would be removed, but rect2 would remain intact. In reality, OpenAccess destroys rect2 in this situation. </p>
<p>In order to remove any confusion, OpenAccess  provides two new APIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>void oaDesign::enableUndo(oaBoolean,  oaUndoModel);<br>
      <br>
    This function lets the application specify which model to use, either <em><em>oacUndoModelPreCheckpoint</em></em>&nbsp; or <em><em>oacUndoModelPostCheckpoint</em></em>. If an application specifies   oacUndoModelPreCheckpoint,&nbsp;&nbsp;an undo operation destroys the last checkpoint   and leaves the results of the preceding operation intact. Using the illustration   above, performing undo after checkpoint 3 was created destroys checkpoint 3   but&nbsp;does not destroy rect2.&nbsp;<BR>
    <br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>void oaDesign::unsetCp();<br>
      <br>
    This function removes the last checkpoint in this design assuming that there are no operations after that last checkpoint. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>OpenAccess also provides new functions that can help applications synchronize the undo state for multiple designs. These functions let applications get and set IDs for checkpoints: </p>
<ul>
  <li>void oaDesign::setCp  	(   	oaUInt4   	  cpID  	);<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>oaUInt4 oaDesign::getCpID  	(   	   	)   	 const;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enhancements to oaInstTerm::create and oaModInstTerm::create</h4>
<p>OpenAccess now provides two use models for creating instTerms in  the block and  module domain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single &ndash; Applications create exactly one instTerm with each function call.</li>
  <li><a name="batch"></a>Batch &ndash; Applications create all the instTerms on an instance with a single function call.</li>
</ul>
<p>In previous releases, applications could  create only one instTerm with each function call.  This single model works well for interactive   applications or  applications that do not know in advance how many   instTerms will be created on a single instance. The new batch model  improves   performance by optimizing the process of instTerm creation when applications know in advance how many instTerms will be created on the   instance.</p>
<p>To support batch instTerm creation,   OpenAccess provides the following new public classes and functions.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Public Classes </h5>

<h4>Minimizing the Use of Virtual Memory</h4>
<p>OpenAccess provides  new functions for minimizing  the amount of virtual memory used by an application on OpenAccess. These functions should be used only when needed because they can significantly impact the performance of  subsequent operations. </p>
<ul>
  <li>void oaSession::minimizeVM()<br>
      <br>
    This function minimizes the amount of virtual memory that 
    
    OpenAccess uses by releasing memory held in reserve for future use and by releasing dynamically allocated data structures that can be rebuilt as
    
    needed. <br>
        <br>
  </li>
  <li>oaDesign::minimizeVM() <br>
      <p>This function minimizes the amount of virtual memory this design uses by releasing dynamically allocated data structures that can be   rebuilt as   needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>oaTech::minimizeVM() <br>
      <p>This function minimizes the amount of virtual memory this technology database uses by releasing dynamically allocated data structures that can be   rebuilt as   needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Spice Namespace</h4>
<p>Name mapping for the OpenAccess Spice namespace is now properly case-insensitive and case-preserving.</p>
<p> Two scalar names initialized  with the strings "abc" and "Abc" in a case-sensitive namespace are now  mapped to "abc" and "%Abc" in the&nbsp; Spice namespace. A name initialized in the Spice namespace with the strings "%Abc" or "%abc" is  mapped to "Abc" in a case-sensitive namespace, such as the OpenAccess native namespace.</p>
<h4>Translator Changes </h4>
<h5>Change to Translator Argument Names </h5>
<p>In previous versions of OpenAccess, each translator used different options and conventions for describing the set of reference libraries and views to translate. For example, <code>verilog2oa</code> used the <code>-leafLibs</code> and <code>-leafViews</code> options, whereas <code>def2oa</code> used <code>-masterLibs</code> and <code>-masterViews</code>.   All translators now use standard options named <code>-refLibs</code> and <code>-refViews</code>. </p>
<p>Refer to the documentation for the individual translators for more information. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The old options are still supported, but they  generate warnings.</p>
<h5>lef2oa Translator </h5>
<p>The <code>lef2oa</code> translator can create oaAttrDisplay objects 
  for each pin shape on  an oaTerm. You can  specify the layer name for the text and the height of the text. If the text layer does not yet exist, it is 
  created (if the technology database is writable). The text is always  written with the purpose &quot;drawing&quot;. </p>
<p>The following new options are available: </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>-pinLabels</code><br>
    Enables the creation of pin labels. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>-textLayer</code><br>
    Specifies the name of the text layer to create (defaults to <code>text</code>).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>-textHeight</code><br>
    Specifies the height of the text (defaults to the current DBU value for maskLayout views).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, in earlier <code>lef2oa</code> implementations, the order of  SPACING statements in the input file affected the generated spacing table. Now the SPACING statements are sorted before processing so that the spacing tables are the same regardless of the order of the SPACING statements. </p>
<h5>def2oa and oa2def Translator </h5>
<ul>
  <li>In previous releases, the <code>def2oa</code> translator exited the translation if the starting layer of a route did not match the vias that followed. Instead, the translator now issues a warning and uses the correct routing layer. For example, <code>ROUTED M1 ( 0 0 ) VIA23 VIA12</code> is now passed through with a warning.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>In previous releases, the<code> oa2def</code> translator exited the translation if the viaDirection attribute of an oaVia in an oaRoute did not match the other elements in the route. Now, the translator issues a warning  and the correct starting layers are output.</li>
</ul>
<h5>strm2oa Translator </h5>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>strm2oa</code> translator  can now accept an asterisk (*) for the library name in the cellMap file, which means that the reference libraries  are searched for the mapped cellName. The <code>strm2oa</code> translator searches only for uppercase names when searching reference libraries if the <code>-toUpper</code> option is specified. Similarly, the translator searches only for lowercase names in the reference libraries if the <code>-toLower</code> option is specified. In previous versions, <code>strm2oa</code> searched first for the case-converted name, then for the non-converted name.<span class="style1"><br>
    </span><br>
  </li>
  <li>The <code>strm2oa -detectVias</code> option   automatically recognizes GDS structures that are vias, and represents them as oaStdVias rather than oaDesigns. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you do not have a viaMap file and you do not use the <code>-detectVias</code> option and provide the necessary information in the layerMap file, the translator produces many oaDesigns to represent the vias. This can adversely affect the performance of both the <code>strm2oa</code> translator and other   applications running on the oaDesigns that are produced. </li>
</ul>
<h5>oaStrm API </h5>
<p>The strmOut class was updated to support via and cell name mapping. In addition, the layerMapIn class was updated to address a problem related to the paths  in map files. </p>
<p>There  oaStrm translator APIs that involve the name mapping from Stream <em>structures</em> to   lib/cell/view names have changed. </p>
<h5>LEF and DEF API </h5>
<p>The DefInNet::createVia function, which used to take an oaPoint, now takes an oaTransform. This change supports rotated vias in DEF 5.6. Derived translators that inherit from DefInNet need to change the signature of the derived createVia function. They do not have to change calls to this function because an oaPoint can be cast to an oaTransform.</p>
<h5>oaVerilog API </h5>
<p>The Verilog translator API has been converted to use <a href="#batch">batch instTerm creation</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="224_up"></a>Version 2.2.4</h2>
<ul>

  <li><a href="#224_up_features">Changes and New Features</a></li>
  <li><a href="#224_up_api_reports">API Changes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#224_up_status">Release Status</a></li>
  <li><a href="#224_up_pcrs">Fixed Problems </a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="224_up_compat"></a>Compatibility with Earlier Releases</h2>
<p>Functions were added in this release, so the <em>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</em> was incremented to 17. Programs compiled with the header files in 2.2.4 <em>or later</em> cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from versions prior to 2.2.4. Programs compiled with versions prior to 2.2.4 will continue to run unchanged with the shared libraries in the current release.</p>
<p>The current <i>oacDataModelRevNumber</i> number, which represents the version of the OpenAccess data model, has been incremented to 1 due to the addition of the Huge Database feature. Refer to <a href="#feature">Feature-Based Compatibility</a>&nbsp; for more information.</p>
<h4><a name="feature"></a>Feature-Based Compatibility</h4>
<p>OpenAccess adds new kinds of data to the data model as newer versions are released. For example, OpenAccess might add new kinds of figures or add support for very large databases. </p>
<p>Each new kind of data added to the data model is called a <em>feature</em>. When a database contains one or more instances of the new kind of data, then it is using that feature. In many cases, older applications will not be able to use databases that have new features. </p>
<p>OpenAccess now includes the infrastructure to support feature-based compatibility. Feature-based compatibility addresses whether or not the databases written by applications built on (or running against) one version of OpenAccess can be read or modified by applications on a different version of OpenAccess. </p>
<p>For more information about feature-based compatibility,   refer to <a href="#dataModelRev">Applications Can Specify Supported Data Model Revision</a>.</p>
<h4>Argument Validation for  Connectivity Creation Functions</h4>
<p>The argument validation for all connectivity creation functions has been updated for consistency. This affects&nbsp;the validation for&nbsp;creation functions in oaNet, oaBusNet, oaModNet, oaModBusNet, oaTerm, oaBusTerm, oaModTerm, and oaModBusTerm. Applications might now get different exceptions for errors than in previous builds of OpenAccess. However the set of possible exceptions has not changed. </p>
<h2><a name="224_up_features"></a>Changes and New Features</h2>
<h4><a name="dataModelRev"></a>Applications Can Specify Supported Data Model Revision</h4>
<p>OpenAccess has a new version of its init functions that an application can use to specify the version of the data model (dataModelRev) that it supports. OpenAccess uses this information to determine whether the application can open databases containing features supported in higher data model revisions.</p>
<pre>extern void oaDesignInit(oaUInt4  apiMajorRev,
                         oaUInt4  apiMinorRev,
                         oaUInt4  dataModelRev);

extern void oaTechInit(oaUInt4    apiMajorRev,
                       oaUInt4    apiMinorRev,
                       oaUInt4    dataModelRev);

extern void oaWaferInit(oaUInt4   apiMajorRev,
                        oaUInt4   apiMinorRev,
                        oaUInt4   dataModelRev);

extern void oaDMInit(oaUInt4      apiMajorRev,
                     oaUInt4      apiMinorRev,
                     oaUInt4      dataModelRev);
</pre>
<p>For example, an application might specify a lower dataModelRev in the oaDesignInit() function to indicate that it does not yet support a new feature, such as Huge Databases, which is defined in the OpenAccess shared libraries with a higher dataModelRev that the application is building against. </p>
<p>The application can call these functions multiple times, but the dataModelRev numbers specified in those calls must be consistent or OpenAccess will throw an exception. The release notes for each OpenAccess release will include information about the current dataModelRev number and any new features included in that release. For more information about these functions and how they affect compatibility, refer  to <a href="../html/guide/compat.html">Compatibility for OpenAccess Applications and Data</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Applications should use the new init functions as the older versions are considered deprecated. For applications that continue calling the older versions of the init functions, OpenAccess will use the data model revision that is defined as the default (oacDataModelRev) in the kit the application was built against, which indicates that the application fully supports the data model defined by the OpenAccess kit. </p>
<h4>Opening Very Large Databases (Huge Databases Feature) </h4>
<p>OpenAccess now provides the ability to open very large database in which a single type of data takes over 4 Gbytes of memory.&nbsp; Refer to the <a href="feature_table.html">Features by Data Model</a> for more information about this feature (which is called Huge Databases). </p>
<h4>oa2verilog Translator Enhancement </h4>
<p>If an OpenAccess module is created without using the <code>verilog2oa</code> translator, it may not be possible to accurately represent the interface to the module in the Verilog language. This commonly occurs when a bit-wise netlist format such as LEF/DEF is used to create leaf cells that have ported busses because the Verilog language does not allow named connections to individual bits of a bus without creating aliases. In such cases, the <code>verilogAnnotate</code> program is used to define the module interface so that it can be expressed using legal port identifiers. </p>
<p>If <code>verilogAnnotate</code> was not used, <code>oa2verilog</code> has been enhanced to take a &ldquo;best guess&rdquo; regarding what the interface to the design should be. When guessing, <code>oa2verilog</code> groups the bits of busses together as long as the bits are either monotonically increasing or decreasing.</p>
<h4>Improved Error and Warning Messages</h4>
<p>The OpenAccess translators have been enhanced to use a standard message format to ensure comprehensive and consistent messaging. In addition, the translator messages have been improved for usability. See the information about interpreting error and warning messages in the individual translator documents for more information.</p>
<h4>Plug-In Registration Files on Windows</h4>
<p>String values in the OpenAccess plug-in registration files use the backslash (\) as an escape character. The escape character itself is ignored and the next character is used literally. As a consequence, a backslash character in a string must be represented with two backslashes (\\), and a double quote can be represented with a backslash and a double quote (\&rdquo;). Strings that represent file paths on the Windows platform must have double backslash characters. For example, the path <code>C:\work\designs</code> should be represented as:</p>
<p> <code>&quot;C:\\work\\designs&quot;</code></p>
<h4>Tcl Changes </h4>
<p>The shared libraries for the Tcl bindings of the OpenAccess API are reorganized. This affects only C++ code that leverages the Tcl bindings as described in the section of the <em>Tcl Bindings for OpenAccess APIs</em> document titled <a href="../html/Tcl/index.html#cppaccess">C++ Access from Tcl</a>. This reorganization does not affect Tcl scripts that employ Tcl OpenAccess commands.</p>
<p>The single oaTcl shared library is now repackaged with five additional shared libraries.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>oaTcl</strong> This shared library, which can be loaded by a Tcl interpreter through the Tcl load command, has not changed. This shared library depends on the five additional shared libraries.</li>
  <li><strong>oaLangBase</strong> This shared library contains support classes to describe OpenAccess classes.</li>
  <li><strong>oaLangInfo</strong> This shared library contains the description of OpenAccess classes and functions.</li>
  <li><strong>oaTclCommon</strong> This shared library provides general support classes for Tcl bindings of C++ types.</li>
  <li><strong>oaTclBase</strong> This shared library provides support classes for Tcl bindings to OpenAccess types.</li>
  <li><strong>oaTclPlugIn</strong> This shared library provides support classes for the Tcl script engine, which is used for Tcl Pcells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shared libraries for custom Tcl bindings, which were previously linked to the single oaTcl shared library, must now be linked to oaTclBase, oaLangInfo, oaTclCommon, oaLangBase and oaTclPlugIn. The previous statement to include the header file oaTcl.h must now be replaced with the statement to include oaTclBase.h.</p>
<h4>Performance Improvement for oaInstTerm::find() and oaOccInstTerm::find()</h4>
<p>The performance of oaInstTerm::find() and oaOccInstTerm::find() are improved for instances in the block domain that have many terminals. In addition, two new oaOccInstTerm::find() methods are added for finding the oaOccInstTerm corresponding to an oaOccInst and either an oaModTerm or an oaTerm.</p>
<h4>Parasitics</h4>
<p>If an application reads a design with parasitics, but does not explicitly access those parasitics, then the files containing the parasitic data are not opened (as they were in previous releases). This leaves more file descriptors available for other uses.</p>

<h2><a name="P031_up_compat"></a>Compatibility with Earlier Releases</h2>
<p>New functions were  added to this release, so the <EM>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</EM> was incremented to 15. Programs compiled with the header files in P031<EM> or later</EM> cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from versions prior to P031. Programs compiled with versions prior to P031 will continue to run unchanged with the shared libraries in the current release.</p>
<h2><a name="P031_features"></a>Changes and New Features</h2>
<h4>Support for Feature-Based Compatibility</h4>
<p>OpenAccess now includes the infrastructure to support feature-based compatibility. Feature-based compatibility addresses whether or not the databases written by applications built on (or running against) one version of OpenAccess can be read or modified by applications on a different version of OpenAccess. </p>
<p>At present, the support is in place for feature-based compatibility, but there are no new features included in OpenAccess.</p>

<h2><a name="P028_status"></a>Release Status</h2>
<p>Some parts of this release are still in development and are considered to be of Beta quality. They are subject to changes in their use and interface. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tcl interface</li>
  <li>Wafer database</li>
  <li>Milkyway to OpenAccess Translator</li>
  <li>Turbo DM System</li>
  <li>Tcl Pcells</li>
  <li>DM interface used by plug-in developers </li>
</ul>
<p>The oaPcellScript Plug-In is in development and is not ready for use at this time. </p>
<h2><a name="P028_up_compat"></a>Compatibility with Earlier Releases</h2>
<p>Functions were added in this release, so the <em>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</em> was incremented to 13. Programs compiled with the header files in 2.2 P028 <em>or later</em> cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from versions prior to 2.2 P028. Programs compiled with versions prior to 2.2 P028  will continue to run unchanged with  shared libraries built from the P028 OpenAccess source code.<span class="style3"> </span></p>
<p>Applications using OpenAccess 2.2.3 shared libraries cannot read designs with parasitics from previous versions. Applications using P028 and later can read parasitics from any previous version. </p>
<p>The argument validation for all connectivity creation functions has been updated for consistency. This affects&nbsp;the validation for&nbsp;creation functions in oaNet, oaBusNet, oaModNet, oaModBusNet, oaTerm, oaBusTerm, oaModTerm, and oaModBusTerm. Applications might now get different exceptions for errors than in previous builds of OpenAccess. However the set of possible exceptions has not changed. </p>
<h2><a name="P028_features"></a>Changes and New Features</h2>
<h4>Improved Error and Warning Messages</h4>
<p>The OpenAccess translators have been enhanced to use a standard message format to ensure comprehensive and consistent messaging. In addition, the translator messages have been improved for usability. See the information about interpreting error and warning messages in the individual translator documents for more information.</p>
<h4>Plug-In Registration Files on Windows</h4>
<p>String values in the OpenAccess plug-in registration files use the backslash (\) as an escape character. The escape character itself is ignored and the next character is used literally. As a consequence, a backslash character in a string must be represented with two backslashes (\\), and a double quote can be represented with a backslash and a double quote (\&rdquo;). Strings that represent file paths on the Windows platform must have double backslash characters. For example, the path <code>C:\work\designs</code> should be represented as:</p>
<p> <code>&quot;C:\\work\\designs&quot;</code></p>
<h4>Parasitics</h4>
<p>If an application reads a design with parasitics, but does not explicitly access those parasitics, then the files containing the parasitic data are not opened (as they were in previous releases). This leaves more file descriptors available for other uses.</p>
<h4>New Translator Option </h4>
<p>OpenAccess is improving the error message format for translators. To preview the new format, use the <code>-newMsgFormat</code> command-line option.</p>
<table width="620" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr bordercolor="1">
    <td width="154">-newMsgFormat</td>
    <td width="446">Use the new format for info, warning, and error messages. Turns on Message IDs, standardized message prefixes, and standardized file and line number information. This option does not alter the message text. This is a temporary option to let users preview the changes planned for messages. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h4>Tcl Changes</h4>
<p>The shared libraries for the Tcl bindings of the OpenAccess API are reorganized. This affects only C++ code that leverages the Tcl bindings as described in the section of the <em>Tcl Bindings for OpenAccess APIs</em> document titled <a href="../html/Tcl/index.html#cppaccess">C++ Access from Tcl</a>. This reorganization does not affect Tcl scripts that employ Tcl OpenAccess commands.</p>
<p>
<p>The single oaTcl shared library is now repackaged with five additional shared libraries.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>oaTcl</strong> This shared library, which can be loaded by a Tcl interpreter through the Tcl load command, has not changed. This shared library depends on the five additional shared libraries.</li>
  <li><strong>oaLangBase</strong> This shared library contains support classes to describe OpenAccess classes.</li>
  <li><strong>oaLangInfo</strong> This shared library contains the description of OpenAccess classes and functions.</li>
  <li><strong>oaTclCommon</strong> This shared library provides general support classes for Tcl bindings of C++ types.</li>
  <li><strong>oaTclBase</strong> This shared library provides support classes for Tcl bindings to OpenAccess types.</li>
  <li><strong>oaTclPlugIn</strong> This shared library provides support classes for the Tcl script engine, which is used for Tcl Pcells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shared libraries for custom Tcl bindings, which were previously linked to the single oaTcl shared library, must now be linked to oaTclBase, oaLangInfo, oaTclCommon, oaLangBase and oaTclPlugIn. The previous statement to include the header file oaTcl.h must now be replaced with the statement to include oaTclBase.h.</p>
<h4>EMH Changes</h4>
<p>The performance of oaInstTerm::find() and oaOccInstTerm::find() are improved for instances in the block domain that have many terminals. In addition, two new oaOccInstTerm::find() methods are added for finding the oaOccInstTerm corresponding to an oaOccInst and either an oaModTerm or an oaTerm. </p>

</ul>
<h2><a name="223_up_status"></a>Release Status</h2>
<p>Some parts of this release are still in development and are considered to be of Beta quality. They are subject to changes in their use and interface. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tcl interface</li>
  <li>Wafer database</li>
  <li>Milkyway to OpenAccess Translator</li>
  <li>Turbo DM System</li>
  <li>Tcl Pcells</li>
  <li>DM interface used by plug-in developers </li>
</ul>
<p>The oaPcellScript Plug-In is in development and is not ready for use at this time. </p>
<h2><a name="223_up_compat"></a>Compatibility with Earlier Releases</h2>
<p>Functions were added in this release, so the <em>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</em> was incremented to 12. Programs compiled with the header files in 2.2.3 <em>or later</em> cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from versions prior to 2.2.3. Programs compiled with versions prior to 2.2.3 will continue to run unchanged with the shared libraries in the current release.</p>
<p><strong>Parasitic Objects With AppDefs </strong></p>
<p>This release fixes a bug with extensions on paged parasitics objects when loading a parasitic network from disk. Previously, applications needed to explicitly create AppDefs for all extensions used in existing parasitic networks to avoid a crash when loading those networks. For databases written by P023 and later, OpenAccess will automatically create any AppDefs needed when loading parasitic networks.</p>
<h2><a name="223_up_features"></a>Changes and New Features</h2>
<h4>Tcl Changes</h4>
<p>In order to eliminate redundancy, the <em>oa::String</em> object has been removed from the oaTcl bindings. All bindings with an oaString parameter now accept a Tcl string as the parameter. </p>
<p>The following oaString member function bindings were removed. </p>
<ul>
  <li> ::oa::index </li>
  <li>::oa::toDouble </li>
  <li>::oa::toInt </li>
  <li>::oa::toLower </li>
  <li>::oa::toUpper</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, all enum values and constant references have been moved from the global Tcl namespace to the the <code>oa::</code> namespace. For example, $oacMaskLayout is now $oa::oacMaskLayout. <FONT face=Arial><SPAN class=064341818-22072005>This change reduces the size of the list that is returned from the <code>info vars</code> command to a more manageable size. If your Tcl program uses these oa values, you can correct it by adding oa:: to the reference, or you can import these symbols to the global namespace with a command such as</SPAN></FONT></p>
<pre>foreach var [info var ::oa::*] {upvar #0 $var ::[namespace tail $var]}</pre>
<p><span class="style2"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Finally, for  consistency with the rest of the OpenAccess code, </SPAN></span><FONT face=Arial size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">the name of the <em>TclException</em> class has been changed to <em>oaTclException</em>, and the <em>getMsg()</em> return value&nbsp;has been changed from <em>std::string</em> to <em>oaString</em></SPAN></FONT>.</p>
<h4>oaString::format Functions </h4>
<p>Three overloaded functions, <a href="../html/base/classoaString.html">oaString</a>::format, have been added. These functions format an oaString object according to the given format specification. </p>
<h4>verilog2oa Translator</h4>
<p>The <code>verilog2oa</code> translator is intended to create new design data, not append to existing design data. Checks have been added to produce an error if you try to use <code>verilog2oa</code> to append to an existing design. Note that <code>verilog2oa</code> has an <code> &ndash;overwrite</code> option if you simply want to overwrite an existing design. </p>
<h4>Behavior Change for oaNet::setSigType and oaModNet::setSigType </h4>
<p>The behavior of the <em>oaNet::setSigType()</em> and <em>oaModNet::setSigType()</em> functions has changed. The <em>sigType</em> attribute of nets is now domain specific. Calling <em>oaNet::setSigType()</em> does not alter the <em>sigType</em> of any related net in either the Module or Occurrence domains. Similarly, calling <em>oaModNet::setSigType()</em> does not alter the <em>sigType</em> of any related net in the Block domain. </p>
<p>The <em>oaNet::getSigType()</em>, <em>oaModNet::getSigType(),</em> and <em>oaOccNet::getSigType()</em> functions each return the <em>sigType</em> of the net in their respective domains. When a net is initially created, the <em>sigType</em> parameter of the create function is copied to all nets implicitly created in other domains. </p>
<p>When reading a database generated with a previous version of OpenAccess, the <em>sigType</em> of the nets in the old database is preserved in the new database. When an old shared library is reading a new database, the <em>sigType</em> of the nets in the Occurrence domain become the <em>sigType</em> of the related nets in all domains with respect to the semantics of the old shared libraries, which supported only a single <em>sigType</em> for all related nets. </p>
<h4>New getCreateTime Functions</h4>
<p>Previously, the values returned by <em>oaDesign::getTimestamp</em> were seeded by the create time of the <em>oaDesign</em>. In order to provide stable values for testing, <em>oaDesign::getTimestamp</em> now returns the number of changes since the <em>oaDesign</em> was created as the time stamp. </p>
<p>Applications can use <em>oaDesign::getCreateTime</em> to distinguish databases that might be identical but that were created at different times.</p>
<p>The following new functions let you get the creation time for the database objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>oaDesign::getCreateTime(); </li>
  <li>oaTech::getCreateTime();</li>
  <li>oaWafer::getCreateTime(); </li>
</ul>
<h4>Deprecated Primitive Types </h4>
<p>The primitive types that were declared in <code>oaCommonTypes.h</code> have been deprecated. Applications should use the equivalent primitive OpenAccess types. The following table shows both the deprecated types and the types that should be used. </p>

      <TD>oaUIntPtr</TD>
    </TR>
  </TBODY>
</TABLE>
<p>All usages of the deprecated types in OpenAccess have been replaced with the equivalent OpenAccess types. This does not affect drop-in compatibility nor compile-time usage for the affected classes. In OpenAccess, the public classes that are affected by this change are defined in the <code>oa/src/common</code> and <code>oa/src/plugin</code> packages.</p>
<h4>oaViaParams Enhancement </h4>
<p>In the oaViaParam class, the cut height and cut width can be controlled separately by using two new enumeration values, oaViaParamTypeEnum::oacCutWidthViaParamType and oaViaParamTypeEnum::oacCutHeightViaParamType.The enumeration value oaViaParamTypeEnum::oacCutSizeViaParamType was formerly used to control both cut width and height simultaneously. That value is now deprecated, but is still supported for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>Conversely, the numbers of cut columns and cut rows are now controlled simultaneously.  Users must either specify them both, or not specify either.   Due to the backward compatibility requirements, the OpenAccess API still supports specifying the numbers of cut rows and cut columns separately (using the methods oaViaParam::setCutRows and oaViaParam::setCutColumns).  However, specifying only one of them without specifying the other results in undefined behavior.</p>
<h4>oaStdViaDef::setParams Enhancement</h4>
<p>In the oaStdViaDef class, the logic of the setParams method has changed. Previously, the parameters from the incoming oaViaParam object were directly copied into the oaStdViaDef object, regardless of their flag values. This behavior required that users explicitly specify all the parameters in the incoming oaViaParam object, even if only one was to be modified. The new implementation accounts for the flag values in the incoming oaViaParam objects, so that only the changed attributes are copied into the oaStdViaDef object. </p>
<h4>oaScanChain Enhancements</h4>
<p><em>oaScanChain::create()</em>, <em>oaScanChain::setStartObject()</em>, and <em>oaScanChain::setStopObject()</em> now check that the start and stop objects are of type <em>oaBitTerm</em>, <em>oaInstTerm</em> or <em>oaScanChainInst</em>, otherwise an <em>oacInvalidScanChainObject</em> exception is thrown.</p>
<h4>New InstTerm getBit() Functions</h4>
<p>New <em>oaInstTerm::getBit()</em>, <em>oaModInstTerm::getBit()</em>, and <em>oaOccInstTerm::getBit()</em> functions allow applications to access a specific member <em>instTerm</em> of a multi-bit <em>instTerm</em>.</p>
<h4>oaTech Attachment Change </h4>
<p >When a tech database is opened for a library, the tech database is associated with the library and remains the tech database for that library until either</p>
<ul>
  <li> The tech database is purged</li>
  <li>The library is closed</li>
</ul>
<p >This is true if the tech database is contained in the library, or if it is attached to the library using the library attachment property.</p>
<p >For example, library1 has a property that forms an attachment to the tech database in library2. Once library1 opens this tech database, the association to the tech database in library2 remains in effect even if the attachment property in library1 is changed or removed. The association remains until the tech database in library2 is purged, or library1 is closed. </p>
<h4>verilog2oa and verilogAnnotate Now Generate Warnings</h4>
<p>OpenAccess requires that all bits of a given port have the same direction. If the Verilog declares a different direction for different bits, the translator issues a warning and picks a single direction to apply to the OpenAccess terminal. Previously, the translator issued an error and exited.</p>
<h4>Package Header File for Verilog Translators</h4>
<p>The package header file for the OpenAccess Verilog translators has been changed to <code>oaVerilog.h</code>. The contents of the <code>oaVerilog.h</code>&nbsp; file were previously contained in two header files: <code>oaVerilogIn.h</code> for the <code>verilog2oa</code> translator and <code>oaVerilogOut.h</code> for the <code>oa2verilog</code> translator. If you have your own Verilog translators built on the OpenAccess Verilog libraries, include <code>oaVerilog.h</code> instead of <code>oaVerilogIn.h</code> or <code>oaVerilogOut.h</code>.</p>
<h4>New EMH Functions</h4>
<ul>
  <li><code>void oaBlock::setVisibleToModule();</code><br>
      <br>
    Specifies that the block is to be visible to the module domain. If the block is already visible to the module domain, this function does nothing. Otherwise, this function creates a top module that inherits all the existing occurrence and block objects in the top occurrence (top block), then sets the top block to be visible to the module domain.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>oaBoolean oaBlock::isVisibleToModule() const;</code><br>
      <br>
    Returns a boolean indicating whether or not this block is visible to the module domain.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>oaCollection oaOccNet::getSpan ( ) const;</code><br>
      <p>Returns a collection of all <em>occNets</em> in the span of this net. The span is defined as the set of nets connected through the module hierarchy within a single <em>oaDesign</em>. Connected nets in other <em>oaDesigns</em> are not included. The span of a net will change as connections to <em>ModTerms</em> and <em>ModInstTerms</em> are changed.<br>
      </p>
  </li>
  <li><code>void oaInstTerm::hide();</code>
      <p>Removes the <em>instTerm</em> from the block domain. The <em>instTerm</em> will not appear in any block domain collections and it will not be returned by any <em>find()</em> functions. This function is not the same as the destroy function because the corresponding <em>instTerms</em> in the module domain are unaffected by <em>hide()</em>. An <em>instTerm</em> must be explicit to be hidden and it must have a corresponding <em>instTerm</em> in the module domain. Hiding a multi-bit <em>instTerm</em> causes all the member <em>instTerms</em> to also be hidden. Hiding an explicit single-bit member of a scalarized multi-bit <em>instTerm</em> hides all the multi-bit owners of the <em>instTerm</em> as well as all the member bits of those <em>instTerms</em>.<br>
      </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>New EMH Functionality </h4>
<p>EMH has been enhanced with regards to the production and processing of objects when modules are uniquified, embedded, or detached (regardless of whether the occurrence hierarchy is bound or unbound). </p>
<p>EMH now attempts to copy, create, bind, and unbind multi-bit, scalarized, implicit objects as the data is being processed. For example, previously when a <em>busNet</em> such as <code>A[0:4]</code> was scalarized, if its module was uniquified, only the explicit <em>busNetBits</em> <code>A[0],&hellip;,A[4]</code> were processed. Now, the implicit <em>busNet</em> <code>A[0:4]</code> is also processed. </p>
<p>The <a href="../html/design/classoaOccTraverser.html"><em>oaOccTraverser</em></a> class has been enhanced with a new flag bit to let applications choose whether they want to process implicit objects.</p>
<h4>Changed oaBusNet Functions</h4>
<p><em>oaBusNet::setBaseName </em>and <em>oaBusNet::setRange</em> now throw exceptions if the new net name conflicts with an existing net (even if that net is implicit), or if the new connectivity results in an illegal <em>oaTerm</em> connection.</p>
<h4>Optionally Building LEF and DEF Translators</h4>
<p>Previously, if you rebuilt the LEF and DEF translators, you had to override the default location of the translators with a LEFDEF_HOME environment variable.&nbsp; Now you can choose to specify the LEF and DEF paths individually with LEF_HOME and DEF_HOME. See <a href="install.html#compiling_trans">Optionally Compiling Translators</a> in the OpenAccess Installation and Configuration Notes. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Very few users need to recompile the OpenAccess translators. You  need to do this if you use an operating system that isn&rsquo;t compatible with one of the pre-built versions, or if you want to modify the distributed translator. </p>
<h4>Implant Enclosures</h4>
<p>The implant enclosure specified for the params for a StandardVia is now relative to the corresponding layer, not relative to the cut as it was previously. See <a href="../html/guide/viaImplantEnc.html">Implant 1/Implant 2 Enclosures</a> in the Programmers Guide for more information.</p>
<h4>Improved Documentation System </h4>
<p>The OpenAccess documentation now provides index pages that let you locate classes according to class categories. See <a href="../html/classes_sel.html">OpenAccess Class Selections</a>. In addition, you can access the list of OpenAccess exceptions from the new Exceptions button at the top of each page. </p>
<h4>Restructuring of Inline Function Definitions</h4>
<p>Inline and template member function implementations have been moved from  class header files to  inline function files. The behavior of the functions has not changed, so  application code is unaffected. The purpose of this change is to inline member functions of two co-dependent classes that need to access each other&rsquo;s members. This change also resolves issues with some versions of compilers related to co-dependent template classes and their member functions.</p>
<h4>Changed Exception</h4>
<p>The exception <em>oacCannotFindAttachedTech</em> has been replaced by the <em>oacCannotFindTechForDesign</em> exception.  Any code that attempted to catch <em>oacCannotFindAttachedTech</em> must be modified accordingly. </p>

</ul>
<h2><a name="221_up_status"></a>Release Status</h2>
<p>Some parts of this release are still in development and are considered to be of Beta quality. They are subject to changes in their use and interface. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tcl interface</li>
  <li>Wafer database</li>
  <li>Milkyway to OpenAccess Translator</li>
  <li>Turbo DM System</li>
  <li>Tcl Pcells</li>
</ul>
<p>The oaPcellScript Plug-In is in development and is not ready for use at this time. </p>
<h2><a name="221_up_compat"></a>Compatibility with Earlier Releases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Functions were added in this release, so the <em>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</em> was incremented to 6. Programs compiled with the header files in 2.2.2 <em>or later</em> cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from versions prior to 2.2.2. Programs compiled with versions prior to 2.2.2 will continue to run unchanged with the shared libraries in the current release.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>A small behavior change affects a number of the &ldquo;set&rdquo; functions on the <em>oaBitNet</em> object. The functions are:
    <ul>
        <li>setConnStatus</li>
      <li>setRoutePattern</li>
      <li>setShieldNet1</li>
      <li>setShieldNet2</li>
      <li>setVoltage</li>
      <li>setOriginal</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    An added check throws an exception if the <em>oaBitNet</em> in question is implicit. The <em>setShieldNet{1,2}</em> and <em>setOriginal</em> functions make an association with another <em>oaBitNet</em>, so an exception is also thrown if the net specified in the argument is implicit. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><em>oaPcellLink::getPcellDef()</em> now functions differently when it cannot find the specified Pcell evaluator. Instead of returning NULL, it throws the exception, <em>oacPcellEvaluatorNotFound</em>. Any applications that use this function must include a try/catch block or verify the evaluator existence with <em>oaPcellLink::find()</em> before using it.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>In prior releases on the Win32 platform, both oaDMTurbo and oaDMFileSys plug-ins were made available as DLLs whether you were using static or dynamic configurations. Now the static configuration generates static libraries for these plug-ins while the dynamic configuration generates DLLs. In static mode, these client-side plugIns are now part of the client execuatble. <br>
      <P>On the Win32 platform, if you are using static mode, you must make sure you initialize these plug-ins with the proper init call. If you have stand-alone OpenAccess-based tests or programs, you must add these init calls to your code. This is done after oaDesignInit() is called. See oa/test/main.cpp as an example.</P>
    <P>You must declare the prototypes in the beginning as follows:</P>
    <PRE>    #if defined(OA_STATIC)
    extern "C" void oaDMTurboInit();
    extern "C" void oaDMFileSysInit();
    #endif
    </PRE>
      <P>Then call them as follows:</P>
    <PRE>        // Initialize.
    oaDesignInit();

    #if defined(OA_STATIC)
        oaDMTurboInit();
        oaDMFileSysInit();
    #endif
    </PRE>
      <P>A similar situation exists if you are using other plug-ins like oaRQXYTree, oaPcellCPP, or oaPcellScript. These have similar init calls that must made in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: This applies only on Win32, only for static builds, and only for your own stand-alone tests. The impacted OpenAccess applications and tests are already updated.</P>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OpenAccess to LEF Mapping Change </p>
    <p>The PREFERENCLOSURE statement now maps to a soft constraint in the FoundryRules constraint group, as opposed to a hard constraint in the LEFDefaultRouteSpec constraint group. Applications need to adjust their code accordingly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="221_up_features"></a>Changes and New Features</h2>
<h3>zlib is Statically Linked to Translators</h3>
<p>Several translators support reading files in the gzip format by using the zlib open source library. The translator executables delivered with OpenAccess previously linked to zlib as a shared library, which forces end users to download and install zlib on their machines. Unlike some other third-party components such as Tcl, the functionality provided by the zlib library is not directly exposed to end users, and there is no need to have multiple tools use the same version of zlib. The translator executables that read files in gzip format now link to zlib as a static library.</p>
<h3>Translators are Built as Static Libraries</h3>
<p>Previously, translator components were delivered as shared libraries, and both the translator executables and other applications linked to them dynamically. Unlike the public OpenAccess API, the interfaces into these translators are subject to change. These changes can affect applications that derive from the translator base classes, as well as applications that simply use the translator components as-is.</p>
<p>When new OpenAccess kits ship (including the translator shared libraries) applications need to use the kits with existing applications. A change to the translator API would break existing applications even though the OpenAccess core remains drop-in compatible.</p>
<p>All translators are now built as static rather than shared libraries. This allows applications to link to a fixed version of the translator API while supporting drop-in compatibility for new OpenAccess kits. In some cases, a bug fix requires both a change to the translator API and a co-dependent change to the OpenAccess kits. In that case, applications that link statically to a translator must be rebuilt in order to pick up part of the fix, and existing executables will not work properly with the new kits. To avoid these problems, the overall architecture for how applications use the translators must change. This issue is currently under consideration by the OpenAccess development team. </p>
<h3>oa, oaCommon, and oaUtil Restructured</h3>
<p>To improve efficiency, avoid inconsistencies between different versions of the modules, and to minimize obscure compilation errors and test failures, oaCommon and oaUtil are now packages within the oa module. The following figure shows the new structure:</p>
<p><img src="images/oaCommon.gif"></p>
<p>Header files from oaCommon are still installed in the top level <code>include/oa</code> directory. Header files from oaUtil were previously installed in <code>include/oaUtil</code>. These are now installed in <code>include/oa</code> for consistency. This should not affect applications that use the translator components because those applications already depend on <code>include/oa</code>. Shared libraries from oaCommon are still installed in the top level <code>lib/<em>&lt;platform&gt;</em>/<em>&lt;mode&gt;</em></code> directory, and DLLs are still installed in the top level <code>bin/<em>&lt;platform&gt;/&lt;mode&gt;</em></code> directory. As part of the change to statically link the translator component libraries, oaUtil now installs static instead of shared libraries in the top level directory.</p>
<h3>Tcl Package Support </h3>
<p>The Tcl binding of OpenAccess supports the Tcl <code>package</code> command, which is preferred over the Tcl <code>load</code> command. Refer to <a href="../html/Tcl/index.html#packagesupport">Package Support</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Dependencies for Building Applications on OpenAccess on Windows</h3>
<p>OpenAccess depends on the Winsock2 socket technology, and therefore must include <code>Winsock2.h</code>. </p>
<p>If your code files contain <CODE>#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;</CODE> statements, adhere to the following rules. </p>
<UL>
  <LI>Place the include statement for the OpenAccess headers before any <CODE>#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;</CODE> statement.<BR>
      <BR>
    or<BR>
    <BR>
  <LI>Place the <CODE>#include &lt;WinSock2.h&gt;</CODE> statement before the <CODE>#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;</CODE> statement. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Note that most users do not specify <CODE>#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;</CODE> statements in their code files because OpenAccess code files already contain include statements for <CODE>Windows.h</CODE>. </P>
<h3>Building the oa20to22 Translator</h3>
<P>The following procedure explains how to build the oa20to22 translator.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Download the following kits for the platform you want: <br>
      <br>
    cdsCommon executable kit <br>
    cdsCommon development kit <br>
    OpenAccess development kit <br>
    OpenAccess source kit <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Expand these four kits in the same directory.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>Refer to <a href="install.html">OpenAccess 2.2 Installation and Configuration Notes</a> for information about how to build OpenAccess.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>Set the environment variable <code>OAHOME_2_0</code> to the directory that contains the expanded kits.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>Add the directory that contains the cdsCommon executables (typically <code>tools.&lt;platformName&gt;/bin</code>) to your executable search path. </li>
</ol>
<h3>oa20to22 Translator Change </h3>
<p><code>oa20to22</code> will now convert 1-bit wide vector objects into the corresponding bit objects. This means that explicit single-bit <em>busNets</em>, <em>busTerms</em>, and <em>vectorInsts</em> are converted into explicit <em>busNetBits</em>, <em>busTermBits</em>, and <em>vectorInstBits</em>.</p>
<h3>LEF/DEF Translators Take a List of Files</h3>
<p>Both <code>lef2oa</code> and <code>def2oa</code> now take a list of files now and process each file in the specified order. For multiple DEF files, if one DEF refers to one of the other specified DEF files (as COMPONENT), the translator handles this reference in any order. You can use  a set of hierarchical DEF files without concern about the order of processing for the files.</p>
<h3>lef2oa Translator Change </h3>
<P>The <CODE>lef2oa</CODE> translator no longer overwrites the <EM>oaDesign</EM> for existing custom vias.</P>
<h3>def2oa Translator Changes </h3>
<ul>
  <li>A <code>-noRouting</code> option is added to the <code>def2oa</code> translator to ignore all routing data and via sections during translation.</li>
  <li>The <CODE>def2oa</CODE> translator now sets the <EM>viaDirection</EM> for <EM>oaVias</EM>. </li>
  <li>Previously, the <code>def2oa</code> translator incorrectly added the LEF WIREEXTENSION value to path segments beginning or ending at vias. Now <code>def2oa</code> correctly adds a value of half of the width to path segments beginning or ending at vias. Note that this is the default DEF behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Calculation of Width for Diagonal Segments by Def Translators</h3>
<p>The DEF translators have been modified to correctly calculate the width of diagonal segments.</p>
<h3><strong>Stream Translator Change </strong></h3>
<p><code>oa2strm</code> now translates the following <em>oaTextDisplay</em> objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>oaAttrDisplay</li>
  <li>oaPropDisplay</li>
  <li>oaTextOverride</li>
</ul>
<p>These <em>textDisplays</em> are translated as labels and are written out as Stream TEXT records. The translation is asymmetric, and these objects return as <em>oaText</em> objects in a round-trip translation. </p>
<p>Note that <em>oaInstAttrDisplay</em> and <em>oaInstPropDisplay</em> are not translated. </p>
<p>The new command line options are as follows.</p>
<table width="719" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <th width="218" scope="col">Option</th>
    <th width="487" scope="col">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>-noOuputTextDisplays</code></td>
    <td>Disables the translation of of <em>textDisplays</em>. The <em>textDisplays</em> are translated by default.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>-text <em>&lt;namespace></em></code></td>
    <td>Some text displays, such as <em>oaAttrDisplay</em>, either require or support namespace namemapping. This options specifies the namespace to use. The valid choices are: <code>"native"</code>, <code>"cdba"</code>, <code>"lef"</code>, <code>"def"</code>, <code>"verilog"</code>, <code>"vhdl"</code>, <code>"spef"</code>, <code>"spf"</code>, and <code>&quot;spice&quot;. </code></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>oa2spef</h3>
<p><code>oa2spef</code> suppresses grounded capacitors whose values are 0.0. If there are multiple values on the capacitor (from multiple analysis points), the capacitor is suppressed only if all the values are 0.0.</p>
<H3>verilog2oa Translator </H3>
<P>The <CODE>verilog2oa</CODE> translator has been updated to better handle expanding multi-bit connectivity. See <a href="../html/verilogmap/verilog2oamap.html#exploding_connect">Expanding Connectivity</a> in the <EM>Verilog to OpenAccess Mapping</EM> document for details.</P>
<h3>oaDefNS and oaSpefNS Namespace Changes</h3>
<p>A name with a double vector notation (name[1][2]) now becomes a <em>vectorBitName</em> with the first bus notation escaped internally (name\[1\][2]).</p>
<p>A name with a bus notation in the middle of the name now becomes a <em>scalarName</em> with the bus notation escaped internally (name[1]a becomes name\[1\]a).</p>
<p> When getting the string from the name, the escaping is undone, so you get the original name back.</p>
<h3>Default Parameters for Pcell References</h3>
<p>The handling of default parameters for Pcell references (including instances and custom vias that are Pcells) has changed. </p>
Previously, any parameter that had the same value as the default value in the <em>superMaster</em> was considered to be a default parameter. These were not stored on the instance and the value would change if the <em>superMaster</em> value changed. Now, a parameter is a default parameter only if it is <em>not</em> explicitly specified during creation or in subsequent calls to <em>setParams()</em>. If a parameter is specified in the reference, it is not a default parameter even if its value equals the default value.
<p></p>
<p>This change impacts <em>getParams()</em> calls to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>oaCustomVia </li>
  <li>oaCustomViaHeader </li>
  <li>oaInst </li>
  <li>oaInstHeader, </li>
  <li>oaModDesignInst </li>
  <li>oaModInstHeader </li>
  <li>oaOccDesignInst </li>
  <li>oaOccInstHeader. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>getParams()</em> will now return any parameter that is explicitly specified on the instance regardless of whether or not its value equals the default value. </p>
<h3>LPP and layerHeaders in Pcell superMasters</h3>
<p>Previously, the LPP and <em>layerHeaders</em> in the Pcell <em>superMaster</em> were filtered out from the parent design that contained instances of the <em>superMaster</em>. This filter has been removed, and the result is that additional LPP and <em>layerHeaders</em> might appear in the parent design if LPP or <em>layerHeaders</em> are in the <em>superMaster</em>, but not in its <em>subMasters</em>.</p>
<h3>Behavior Change for oaFig::copy and oaFig::move for Pcells </h3>
<p>The behavior of <em>oaFig::copy()</em> and <em>oaFig::move()</em> has changed with regards to copying or moving an unbound Pcell instance across designs. The copy and move functions will now more closely match Pcell instance creation. Accordingly, the copy and move functions will force the master to load to ensure that the <em>instHeader</em> created in the destination design is consistent with the source. The exceptions <em>oacCannotCopyPcellInst</em> and <em>oacCannotMovePcellInst</em> are thrown if the master cannot be found.</p>
<h3><SPAN class=507101019-11032005>Implementing Pcells Through Tcl (Beta Version) </SPAN></h3>
<p><SPAN class=507101019-11032005>OpenAccess implements Pcells in Tcl using the oaPcellScript and oaTclEngine plug-ins. The oaPcellScript plug-in is a Pcell evaluator that uses a scripting engine to interpret a content generation procedure written in a scripting language that supports the OpenAccess binding. Provided the necessary scripting engine, the Pcell evaluator can work with different types of scripting languages. The oaTclEngine is a scripting engine included with OpenAccess that provides the OpenAccess binding through the oaTcl shared library. The oaTclEngine plug-in supports Tcl version 8.4.1 or later.</SPAN></p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../html/guide/tclpcell.html">Implementing Pcells Through Tcl</a>. </p>
<h3>oaPcellScript Plug-In (Development Version) </h3>
<p>Note that the oaPcellScript Plug-in is included in this release, but it is not ready for use and is still under development.</p>
<h3>Documentation Change for oaNameMem::getValue() </h3>
<p>The documentation for this function has been updated to state that this function is only intended for use by nameSpaces.</p>
<h3>Unbinding Occurrence Hierarchies Has More Consistent Behavior</h3>
<p>When an occurrence hierarchy or sub-hierarchy is unbound from the top occurrence hierarchy, OpenAccess now consistently removes the hierarchy from the occurrence domain. The public <em>occObjects</em> in the sub-hierarchy and the non-local occurrence hierarchies are destroyed, and the annotations in the occurrence domain are removed.</p>
<h3>Uninstalling OpenAccess on UNIX Platforms</h3>
<p>Uninstallers are no longer provided for UNIX platforms. Use the <code>rm</code> command instead:</p>
<pre>% rm -r <em>&lt;install_dir&gt;</em> </pre>
<H3>DM FileSys Plug-In </H3>
<P>If DM FileSys cannot deterimine the viewType of a cellView, the cellView is ignored rather than throwing an exception.</P>
<h3>New APIs </h3>
<p>The following new APIs are available.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new <a href="../html/design/classoaScriptEngineLink.html">oaScriptEngineLink</a> class is a container class for IScriptEngine, which is the interface for a script engine. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><code>oaObject::hasProp()</code><br>

      <br>
    Returns the creation time of the file on the disk. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><code>oaModNet::setSigType(oaSigType sigType)</code><br>
      <br>
    Changes the <em>sigType</em> on the <em>modNet</em> and all occurrences of the <em>modNet</em>.</li>

      <br>
    Returns the relative orientation required to transform this orientation to the specified target orientation 'orient'.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <code>oaVector::normalize()</code><br>
      <br>
    Normalizes this vector to a unit vector. </li>
</ul>
<H3>oaBoundary and Derived Classes</H3>
<P>Due to code optimizations, the order in which points are returned for a rectangular boundary can differ from the order in which they were entered.</P>
<H3>oaName Utility Classes </H3>
<P>New <EM>operator==</EM> and <EM>operator!=</EM> methods are available on the <EM>oaName</EM>, <EM>oaBundleName</EM>, <EM>oaSimpleName</EM>, <EM>oaVectorName</EM>, <EM>oaVectorBitName</EM>, and <EM>oaScalarName</EM> utility classes. See the <a href="../html/classes.html">API documentation</a> for more information.</P>
<H3>oaTech Class </H3>
<P>The following APIs have been added to the <a href="../html/tech/classoaTech.html">oaTech</a> class:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <PRE>void oaTech::destroy(const oaScalarName &amp;libName)</PRE>
  <LI>
    <PRE>void oaTech::destroy(oaLib *lib)</PRE>
  <LI>
    <PRE>oaLib* oaTech::getLib()</PRE>
  </LI>
</UL>
<h3>Functions that Take a Database Argument</h3>
<p>All API's that take an <code>oaObject *database</code> now throw a common <em>oacInvalidDatabase</em> exception. Most of these functions previously threw individual exceptions. </p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="#221_compat">Compatibility with Earlier Releases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#221_api_reports">API Changes</a></li>

</ul>
<h2><a name="221_compat"></a>Compatibility with Earlier Releases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most users will have to rebuild their tech DBs with the OpenAccess libraries and the <code>lef2oa</code> translator in this release for the following reasons.
    <ul>
        <li>Due to a bug fix, tech DBs that used the default values for User Units and DBUPerUU in 2.2.0 will now contain incorrect values.</li>
      <li>The LEF mapping for routing rules has changed because these rules were previously placed in the wrong constraint group. In 2.2.1, the <code>oa2lef</code> translator expects this data to be in the <code>LEFDefaultRouteSpec</code> constraint group. </li>
      <li>In 2.2.0 constraints placed in the foundry constraint group were incorrectly placed in the tech default constraint group. </li>
      <li>Older versions of <CODE>lef2oa</CODE> incorrectly stored X pitch and offset values in the <EM>oacHorizontalRouteGridPitch</EM> and <EM>oacHorizontalRouteGridOffset</EM> constraints. Now X pitch and offset are correctly mapped to <EM>oacVerticalRouteGridPitch</EM> and <EM>oacVerticalRouteGridOffset</EM>. Y pitch and offset values were also incorrectly mapped and are now correctly mapped to <EM>oacHorizontalRouteGridPitch</EM> and <EM>oacHorizontalRouteGridOffset</EM>.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Because new functions have been added in this release, the <em>oacMinorRevNumber</em> has been incremented. This means that programs compiled with the header files in this release cannot be used with OpenAccess shared libraries from previous 2.2 releases. Programs compiled with earlier versions of 2.2 will continue to run unchanged with the shared libraries in this release. For more information about the <em>oacAPIMinorRevNumber</em>, refer to <a href="../html/guide/helloworld.html#3">oaDesign Initialization</a> in the Programmers Guide.</li>
  <li>If you used oaFatal exceptions, you need to remove them and recompile your code. (Most applications do not use these exceptions.) See <a href="#fatal">Removal of Fatal Exceptions</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="221_features"></a>New Features</h2>
<h3>Translators</h3>
<p>The lib, cell, and view names that you supply to the translators on the command line are now in the OpenAccess <a href="../html/guide/namemap.html#9">Native name space</a>.</p>
<h4>Spef Translators</h4>
<p>The <code>zlib</code> library, which is required by the Spef translators, is no longer shipped with OpenAccess. For information about acquiring and setting up <code>zlib</code>, see the <a href="install.html#instruct">Installation Instructions</a>. </p>
<p>Also, <code>spef2oa</code> now includes a <code>-tolerate</code> command-line option, which tolerates connectivity mismatches between the SPEF input and the target OpenAccess database. Usually, connectivity mismatches result in an error and processing stops. The <code>&ndash;tolerate</code> option reduces these errors to warnings, but some coupling capacitance may be dropped from the parasitic network. If the network cannot be properly connected due to connectivity problems with series devices (such as resistors), the entire network is ignored but processing continues. Note that the SPEF translator does not perform exhaustive node to node checking of the network connectivity. It is possible to construct networks that contain electrical opens regardless of whether this option is used.</p>
<h4>Stream Translators</h4>
<p>The Stream translators include a new <code>-viaMap</code> option to support inputting and outputting custom via mappings. </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
  <tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    <td width="116"><span class="code">-viaMap <em>file</em> </span></td>
    <td width="665"><p>For <code>oa2strm</code>, produces a via mapping file that lists all of the structures output that are masters for CustomViaDefs. </p>
        <p> For <code>strm2oa</code>, specifies an input file that defines which structures to recognize as CustomViaDef masters. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h5>Custom Via Mapping File Syntax</h5>
<pre># Comment
# Blank lines will be ignored
&lt;Structure Name&gt; &lt;oaCustomViaDef Name&gt; &lt;Layer1 Name/Number&gt; &lt;Layer2 Name/Number&gt; </pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre># Custom Via Master List for mydesign
via1 m1m2via m1 10 m2 20
via2 m2m3via m2 20 m3 30</pre>
<h4>oa2lef Translator</h4>
<p>The PITCH, DIAGPITCH, and OFFSET constructs have been moved to the LEFDefaultRouteSpec constraint group. Previously generated tech databases are incompatible because <code>oa2lef</code> will no longer find these constructs in the foundry rules group. </p>
<h4>LEF/DEF  Mapping Changes </h4>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>lef2oa</code> mapping has changed. Older versions of <code>lef2oa</code> incorrectly stored X pitch and offset values in the <em>oacHorizontalRouteGridPitch</em> and <em>oacHorizontalRouteGridOffset</em> constraints. Now X pitch and offset are correctly mapped to <em>oacVerticalRouteGridPitch</em> and <em>oacVerticalRouteGridOffset</em>. Y pitch and offset values were also incorrectly mapped and are now correctly mapped to <em>oacHorizontalRouteGridPitch</em> and <em>oacHorizontalRouteGridOffset</em>. </li>
  <li>LEF vias are mapped to oaCustomViaDefs. If an existing oaStdViaDef is defined in the technology database with the same name, the oaCustomViaDef is renamed by appending _via. For example, &lt;name&gt; is renamed to &lt;name&gt;_via.</li>
  <li>def2oa searches for oaCustomViaDef &lt;name&gt;, oaCustomViaDef &lt;name&gt;_via, oaStdVia (not oaStdViaDef), and DEF VIA (a via defined locally in the DEF file); the search is performed in the order listed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wafer API Changes </h3>
<p>Two new wafer functions have been added:</p>
<pre>oaTimeStamp             getTimeStamp(oaWaferDataType    type) const;

oaTimeStamp             getTimeStamp(oaAppObjectDef     *def) const;
</pre>
<h3>New Overload for oaCellView::setView</h3>
<pre>void oaCellView::setView(const oaView *view); // Already exists
void oaCellView::setView(const oaView *view, oaBoolean mustExist); // New overload 
</pre>
<p>These functions modify the cellView that is associated with the specified view.</p>
<p><code>oaCellView::setView(const oaView *view)</code> accomplishes this by renaming the existing primary data in the cellView to be of the appropriate type. An exception is thrown if the non-primary data already exists in the cellView of the specified type.</p>
<p><code>oaCellView::setView(const oaView *view, oaBoolean mustExist)</code> assumes the cellView already contains the appropriate type of data, but that it is not currently marked as the primary data for the cellView. This function makes this data primary. The original data is left in the cellView as non-primary data. The argument <code>mustExist</code> should be set to TRUE. If <code>mustExist</code> is set to FALSE, this function operates identically to the first version.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To maintain drop-in compatibility, these functions are implemented separately, but will be merged together at a later date. </p>
<h3>New Turbo DM System Attribute</h3>
<table width="780" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>maxFilesPerDataDir</td>
    <td>Specifies how many files are created before the Turbo DM system starts creating subdirectories to store the files. This number is also used as the maximum number of files to include in the subdirectories.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>See <a href="../html/guide/libstruc.html#turbo">Turbo DM System</a> in the <em>Libraries and Design Management</em> section of the Programmers Guide for more information. </p>
<h4>FileSys File Locking Use Model</h4>
<p>The file locking functionality for the FileSys DM system is fully documented. The lock recovery daemon is now called <code>oaFSLockD</code>. </p>
<p>See <a href="../html/guide/libstruc.html#file_locking">File Locking</a> in the <em>Libraries and Design Management</em> section of the Programmers Guide for more information. </p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>The distance parameter has been added to the <a href="../html/guide/oacMinWireExtensionConstraint.html">oacMinWireExtension</a> constraint. </p>
<h3>Default Compiler Environment</h3>
<p>There has been a change to the default compiler environment path settings supplied with OpenAccess. See <a href="install.html#def_compile">Default Compiler Environment</a> for details.</p>
<h3><a name="fatal"></a>Removal of Fatal Exceptions </h3>
<p>The following fatal exception classes have been removed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>oaFatal</li>
  <li>oaDesignFatal</li>
  <li>oaTechFatal</li>
  <li>oaDMFatal </li>
  <li>oaWaferFatal</li>
</ul>
<p> OpenAccess does not throw exceptions using any of these objects, so they have been eliminated. The expectation is that clients are not using these class types to catch OpenAccess exceptions because OpenAccess does not throw these exception objects. </p>
<p>Almost all clients use the base oaException type in the catch block to get a copy or a reference of the thrown object. There should be no drop-in compatibility issues for these clients, and eliminating these classes now will prevent unnecessary confusion in the future. </p>
<p>Clients that have catch blocks to specially handle these fatal exception types should remove them.</p>
